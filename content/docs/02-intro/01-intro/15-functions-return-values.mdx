## Learning Objectives

- Understand what is meant by the term **return value** of a function
- Understand how to set the evaluation value of a function call expression

## Function return values

When we call a function, the evaluation value of the function call expression is also called the **return value**.

For example when we call `'Hello'.toUpperCase()`, the return value of the `toUpperCase` is a string `'HELLO'`. We could also say that the function **returns** a string `'HELLO'`.

When we have written our own functions so far, we have always seen them evaluating to `undefined` when we call them - they always return `undefined`.

In this lesson we will look at why that is, and how we can control the return value of our functions.

We will try to write a function that triples a number. The function will be called with a number as an argument, and the function will return that number multiplied by three.

The result will look like this:

```js
triple(5); // evaluates to 15
triple(2); // evaluates to 6
```

Let's start by defining an empty function:

```js
function triple() {};
```

When we call the function, the evaluation value is `undefined`:

```js
function triple(number) {};

triple(5); // evaluates to undefined
triple(2); // evaluates to undefined
```

The next step would be to add in a parameter to the function, and multiply its value by 3.

```js
function triple(number) {
  number * 3;
};
```

But when we call the function, we still get `undefined`:

```js
function triple(number) {
  number * 3;
};

triple(5); // evaluates to undefined
triple(2); // evaluates to undefined
```

If we try to `console.log` the `number * 3` statement, we can see that JavaScript is executing the expression and performing the calculation.

```js
function triple(number) {
  number * 3;
};

triple(5); // prints 15, evaluates to undefined
triple(2); // prints 6, evaluates to undefined
```

The first function call prints `15` but evaluates to `undefined`. The second function call prints `6` but evaluates to `undefined`.

We need a way to get that calculated value out of the function!

To do this, we can use the `return` keyword:

```js
function triple(number) {
  return number * 3;
};

triple(5); // evaluates to 15
triple(2); // evaluates to 6
```

Now our function works as we want it to!

To get a value out of a function, you **must** use the `return` keyword. If a function doesn't have a return statement, it will always return undefined.

However, in some cases you might not be interested in the return value of a function, and that's fine. For example with `console.log` we use it to print a message to a screen, not to calculate a new value. In these cases, no return statement is needed.

### Early returns

An interesting feature of the `return` keyword in JavaScript is that it will stop the execution of your function immediately.

Look at the following example:

```js
function myFunction() {
  console.log('HELLO');
  return 10;
  console.log('GOODBYE');
}
```

The code in this function contains 3 statements for the computer to execute. But when we call the function, only two of the statements will be executed. The last statement `console.log('GOODBYE');` will never happen:

```js
myFunction();
```

This is because the function contains a `return` statement before the final `console.log`. Any code in a function after a `return` statement will not be executed.
