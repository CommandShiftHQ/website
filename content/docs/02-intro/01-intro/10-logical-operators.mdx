## Learning Objectives

- Understand how to ask questions about multiple boolean values at the same time
- Understand how we can use the **not** operator (`!`) to write logical expressions in different ways

We have seen how we can use comparison and arithmetic operators to combine two values into a new value. Most of the operators we've seen so far have mainly been useful when working with numbers, and a few we have been able to use with strings.

But what about booleans? In what circumstances might we want to use operators with boolean values, and how can we do that in JavaScript?

The answer is to use **logical operators**. These operate on two boolean values, and evaluate to give a new boolean value.

## When to use logical operators

We've seen previously that we can use boolean values to make decisions using **conditional logic** and **if statements**.

In this example, we're checking that the password entered by the user matches the secret password in our program.

But what if we wanted to check more than one thing?

Maybe we could also ask them for a username, then we would only grant access if the username was correct **AND** the password was correct.

Or maybe we could also the option to enter a PIN number instead of a password. We would grant access to the user if the PIN was correct **OR** if the password was correct.

Let's take a look at how we can implement these two features using JavaScript.

## And Operator (`&&`)

When we use this operator with two boolean values, it will only evaluate to `true` when both values are `true`. Otherwise it will evaluate to `false`.

That is, it will be `true` if the left-hand side **AND** the right-hand side are `true`.

Try the following in your console:

![and-logic](https://a.storyblok.com/f/79570/422x462/9abccdebb3/14.png)

The only time we got `true` was the first example, when both values were `true`.

To solve the problem of how to check both a username and password, we already know how to check the password and the username individually:

![username](https://a.storyblok.com/f/79570/874x464/49f4788b18/15.png)

Here, the user entered the correct password, but the wrong username.

To check that both of these checks evaluate as `true`, we can combine these two individual checks using the `&&` operator:

![username-password](https://a.storyblok.com/f/79570/1020x350/9a0c1954bd/16.png)

We could then put that statement into the if-statement to make our program run as we want:

![username-password-full](https://a.storyblok.com/f/79570/1034x478/ca6f7e816f/17.png)

## Or Operator (`||`)

When we use this operator with two boolean values, it will only evaluate to `false` if both values are `false`. That means if at least one value is true, the whole statement will be true.

That is, it will be `true` if the left-hand side **OR** the right-hand side are `true`.

Try the following in your console:

![or-logic](https://a.storyblok.com/f/79570/426x456/7e6056b290/18.png)

To solve the second problem of how to accept either a password or a PIN number, we can take a similar approach to the previous problem.

We already know how to check the password and the PIN number individually:

```js
const correctPassword = 'SecretPassword';
const correctPin = '1234';
const password = prompt('What is your password?'); // hint: enter the wrong password
const pin = prompt('What is your PIN number?'); // hint: enter the correct PIN!

password === correctPassword; // false
pin === correctPin; // true
```

To check that at least one of these checks evaluate as `true`, we can combine these two individual checks using the `||` operator:

```js
const correctPassword = 'SecretPassword';
const correctPin = '1234';
const password = prompt('What is your password?'); // hint: enter the wrong password
const pin = prompt('What is your PIN number?');  // hint: enter the correct PIN!

password === correctPassword || pin === correctPin; // true
```

This evaluates as `true`, since the second part `pin === correctPin` is `true`.

We could then put that statement into the if-statement to make our program run correctly:

```js
const correctPassword = 'SecretPassword';
const correctPin = '1234';
const password = prompt('What is your password?');
const pin = prompt('What is your PIN number?');

if (password === correctPassword || pin === correctPin) {
  console.log('Access Granted!');
} else {
  console.log('Access Denied!');
}
```

## Not Operator (`!`)

This handy little operator is unusual because it only works with a single value. When we use it with a boolean value, it will evaluate as the opposite boolean value:

```js
!true; // false
!false; // true
```

It's useful because it allows us to express logical statements in an alternative way.

For example, we might want to check that somebody is at least 18 years. In English, different people might express this idea in two different ways:

- 'Check that their age is greater than or equal to 18.'
- 'Check that their age is not less than 18.'

In JavaScript, we could write the first statement as follows:

```js
const age = 16;

age >= 18; // false
```

Or alternatively, we could express it in the second way:

```js
const age = 16;

!(age < 18); // false
```

Because `age < 18` is `true`, by using the `!` operator, we can obtain the opposite value.

N.B. here we are using brackets to make the statement a little clearer. We'll see more about this in the next lesson.
