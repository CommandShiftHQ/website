title: "Multiple Component Mapping - Walkthrough"
---

Let’s take another look at our conditional render: 

```jsx
  if (!results.length) {
    return <p>No results</p>;
  } else {
    return (
      <>
        <img src="a random single image" />
      </>
    );
  }
```
Here we’re only rendering one image, but what if `state` is an array and we need multiple components?

```jsx
  if (!results.length) {
    return <p>No results</p>;
  } else {
    return (
      <>
        {results.map((image) => (
          <img className="card-image" src={image} alt="spaceImage" />
        ))}
      </>
    );
  }
```

Here we’re saying if `results` array (which is a state `searchResults` in `<App />` and it's passed to `<SearchResults />` as a prop) has a length, then take that prop and `map` over it. Take each element in within our `results` (if you check `getImages()` you'll see we've taken only `url` of images) and place it inside of the `img` where the `src` attribute is.

You should now have a working app! Well done!
