title: "Multiple Component Mapping"
---

Okay, at the moment we’re only rendering one image inside of our `<SearchResults />` component when really we need as many of them as there are in our request.

Inside our conditional render block in `SearchResults` where we say if `results` exists render an image, we’re going to make a change.

We will keep, our conditions of, if `results.length` and after we will say, take `results` and `map` over our state and return an `img` with the `src` passed into it.

If you manage to successfully do this you’ll get multiple images returned on your page when you complete a search. You will also notice it doesn’t look great so you will have to do some styling to make things more presentable.

This is tricky if you’ve never done it before but have a go at trying to work it out before moving on to the walkthrough. Good luck!
