Okay so we've got our project set up, we've cleaned up and we're ready to get cracking!

Let's check out the brief for our technical test:

```plaintext
Technical Task - React Developer Role

You are expected to build a React web application that allows users to search for images based on a query relating to space. You are provided the NASA API endpoint for image search.
We want you to consider and add anything to your repository that should be included was this to be a live website.

The following functionalities need to be implemented:
● A Search page which allows users to search for images by keyword
● Images must be returned upon a successful search

The styling is up to you but will be taken into consideration when evaluating your application.

We estimate this task to take ​​10 hours​​. Once you have completed the task upload the repository to GitHub and send the link to xxxxx@xxx.com. ​Deadline: 5 days from receiving.

Relevant API endpoints:

image search:
GET​​ ​​https://images-api.nasa.gov/search ​Params: ​​q

Assets

You may use this asset for your application: https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200424060716-nasa-worm-logo.jpg

Okay, so things just got real for a second. Once the panic subsides, let's break down the task into achievable chunks and go from there.

1. Build a search input
2. Create a function that GETs the images
3. Build a component that renders images on the page
4. Write tests
5. Finishing styling

This is roughly the order we'll complete the task in, remember that this is our draft version. We won't be submitting this particular version once we're done but more on that later.
