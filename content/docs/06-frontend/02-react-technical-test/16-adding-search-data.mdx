title: "Adding Search Data"
---

First, let’s start by opening our `App.js` file and taking a look at our `searchResults` state. If you `console.log` it, you will see it contains an array for 100 images. You will also see that it says `Promise: undefined` - `Promise: resolved`, we’ll get to this in a minute. 

Inside the `searchResults` hook, make sure the default state is an empty array, otherwise the app will crash before we do a search.

Now we’re going to try using `map` on `searchResults` to get each item individually instead of one big array. 

So let’s try `searchResults.map((e) => console.log(e))`.

This should return every image as its own entity on a search. Try running a search now.

What happened?

You should have got an error saying that ‘map’ has caused an issue somewhere. 

This is because our `GET` request is asynchronous. The function fires on submit when our promise is empty as it takes a second to return the payload of the 100 images. This is what we were seeing in the `console.log()` before when it said `Promise: undefined` - `Promise: resolved`. JavaScript is just too fast for its own good sometimes.

Let’s fix this.

Head over to `Search.js`.

We need to add `async` and `await` keywords to our `handleSubmit` to tell it what order to do things.

Add `async` just before function assigned to `handleSubmit` starts (between the first `=` and `(event)` param). This tells the function that it is asynchronous. Then inside the parentheses of `setSearchResults()` before `getImages()` add the `await`.
This tells the function to not return anything until this action has been performed. This will now stop it returning undefined before the promise is resolved.

Let’s try our app again. Do a search and see what happens. It should work perfectly this time and you should see the results appear in your browser console. If they don’t, phone a friend…

Awesome, now we can remove the line where we map through searchResults and return `console.log` from `App`, confident that we know what we’re getting back and our request is working as intended.
