So we've updated our `Search.js` component with an event handler, a form, and a button. Here's what it should look like: 

```jsx
import React, { useState } from "react";
import "../styles/search.css";

const Search = () => {
  const [value, setValue] = useState();

  return (
    <>
      <form className="search-form">
        <input
          className="search-input"
          type="text"
          onChange={(e) => setValue(e.target.value)}
        />
        <button className="search-btn" type="submit">
          Go!
        </button>      
      </form>
    </>
  );
};

export default Search;
```

This is only a small amendment to our component but we will come back soon to make some more changes.
