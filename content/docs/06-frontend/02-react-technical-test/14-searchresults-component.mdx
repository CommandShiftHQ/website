title: "SearchResults Component"
---

Now we’re going to create the component that will render our search results on the page.

Let’s make a start by creating a `SearchResults.js` file inside our `components` folder and the corresponding test and css files in their respective folders.

Inside this file, import react and create a stateless functional component as we did before.

Inside the component body, create a `Fragment` and for now, create a `p` tag with "Search Results" inside.

Now import this component into our `App.js` file and render `<SearchResults />` beneath `<Search />` in the component body.

You should see `Search Results` now rendering in the browser. If it is, we’re good to move on.

Have a go at building this component on your own. Use the following mock data for now and once we’re done building our component we’ll remove the data for our search results instead.

Once done, remember to write some tests for this component and we’ll move on to replacing our mock data with real search data.
