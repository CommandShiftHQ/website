title: "CSS in React"

## Overview
At the moment your app should look something like this:

In this step, we're going to look at adding some CSS to our React app. With a normal HTML page, we would require any CSS styles to be wrapped inÂ `<style>`Â tags or we could link an external stylesheet using a `<link>` tag in the documentÂ `<head>`.

In React we have a couple of ways to include CSS as well. Let's start with the simplest one.

## Requirements

The main requirement is to have our app looking like the design below, therefore:

1. Location details are displayed at the top, and left aligned.
2. Forecasts for each day are displayed in the middle, placed horizontally and spaced out evenly.
3. Forecast details are displayed at the bottom and centred.

It looks like you don't have to style location details, but the rest needs some work. For now let's only do point 2, as we haven't built the `<ForecastDetails />` component yet.

## Technical task breakdown

1. Style `<App />`, but only the container element (add margin).
2. Make sure you have the `App.css` stylesheet imported into your `App.js` file.
3. Add stylesheet `ForecastSummaries.css`, and style the layout of `<ForecastSummaries />` using flexbox.
4. Don't forget to import styles into `ForecastSummaries.js`.
5. Think how you can check in dev tools if styles were applied and imported into our app.

ðŸ’¡ CSS stylesheets - using React (more accurately using Webpack that is used inside `react-scripts`), we can import CSS files into our JavaScript directly. Even better, we can break our CSS files down by component and import them directly into that component.
