## Icons

If you have a failing test related to your icons the problem is likely down to an invalid prop in your test file.

In `ForecastSummary.test.js`:

```js
const validProps = {
  date: 1111111,
  description: "Stub description",
  icon: "800",
  temperature: {
    min: 12,
    max: 22,
  },
};
```

In `ForecastSummaries.test.js` use ids "800" and "602". Feel free to use different icon ids, just check the [icon docs](https://openweathermap.org/weather-conditions) first.

Now just update the snapshots in the console!

## Dates

To fix a failing tests related to the dates you need to change the expected value for assertion in `ForecastSummary.test.js` from:

```js
    expect(getByText("1111111")).toHaveClass("forecast-summary__date");
```

to:

```js
    expect(getByText("Thu Jan 01 1970")).toHaveClass("forecast-summary__date");
```

The reason being the `date` value in `validProps` is still correct, but since we altering it, we expect a human-readable date in the desired format to be returned.

Remember to update snapshots again!
