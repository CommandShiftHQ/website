## Solution

#### 1. Style `<App />`, but only the container element (add margin).

To begin, find the directory you created earlier `src/styles` and the file you moved there called `App.css`.

In your `<App />` component, make sure the top level `div` has a `className` prop with a value of `"weather-app"`, and then in your `App.css` file write some css which does the following:

```css
.weather-app {
  margin: 0 20px;
}
```

üí° We've changed the class name from `App` (which came with CRA), to `weather-app` for couple of reasons:

1. Our app is not anonymous, it's a Weather App. If you combine it with other modules (maybe it's going to be a microservice application in a bigger system?) you might want to use a specific class name to avoid two nodes having the same class name.
2. It's a way more common convention to use **lowercase** class names for styling in general. Most often it's combined with **kebab case** (yes, that's a real name üôÉ An example of kebab case is `product-card-return-more`. There is also `camelCaseForJavaScript`, and snake case in PHP: `some_php_variable`).
3. We're using BEM naming convention for this project, where each part, BLOCK, ELEMENT, and MODIFIER use lowercase + kebab case, and then is separated from another by either `__` or `--`, for example: `product-card__return-more--active-form`.

‚ö†Ô∏è Please bear in mind, choice of class naming convention is either a personal preference (if you work on your own) or an agreed solution (if you're in a team), but it's better to follow well-known standards instead of creating something completely new or using casing that has been adopted by other other languages and frameworks.

#### 2. Make sure you have the `App.css` stylesheet imported into the `App.js` file.

`<App />` component should have these files imported:

```js
import React from 'react';
import LocationDetails from './LocationDetails';
import ForecastSummaries from './ForecastSummaries';

import '../styles/App.css';
```

#### 3. Add stylesheet `ForecastSummaries.css`, and style layout of `<ForecastSummaries />` using flexbox.

Add another stylesheet, `ForecastSummaries.css`, which targets the `forecast-summaries` class and applies the following rules:

```css
.forecast-summaries {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
}
```

#### 4. Don't forget to import styles into `ForecastSummaries.js`.

Import this file into `<ForecastSummaries />`, and suddenly your application should look a lot nicer.

```js
import React from 'react';
import ForecastSummary from './ForecastSummary';

import '../styles/ForecastSummaries.css';
```

#### 5. Think about how you can check in dev tools if styles were applied and imported into our app.

Take a look at the html `<head>` tag in the browser dev tools - you'll see a couple of `<style>` tags. If you compare this to the `index.html` file in your repo, there is no reference to any stylesheets in `index.html`. These style tags have been dynamically injected into the DOM by Webpack and they contain the styles from your stylesheets.
