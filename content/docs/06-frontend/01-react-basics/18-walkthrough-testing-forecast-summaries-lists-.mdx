title: "Walkthrough: Testing Forecast Summaries (lists) ðŸ”¬"

## Overview

Let's go through the questions we asked earlier:

#### 1. What could be the most important thing to test here? Please remember that tests for particular values already have been tested.

Think first what `<ForecastSummaries />` is rendering? A list of items nested in a `<div/>`! What we care about here is whether or not it renders the right number of elements and if it renders the outer `<div/>`.

#### 2. What should be tested first?

Let's keep tests consistent and test for snapshots first, then we can test this component further.

#### 3. What type of queries and assertions might you want use this time?

We can't really try to find elements here by text, as by default each of the items will display different data. We can reach all elements by providing them with a shared attribute instead. In this case we might want to use `getAllByTestId()`. To count how many elements are rendered we can use `toHaveLength()`.

For snapshot testing we will use the same query and assertion as before.

## Solution

### Snapshot testing

#### 1. Create test file, add describe block with `validProps`.

Let's have a look at how we might test multiple props that have been passed into a component via an array before being rendered. There is no big difference in how many objects this array will have, but would be good if it was more than 1.

```jsx
describe("ForecastSummaries", () => {
  const validProps = [
    {
      date: 1111111,
      description: "Stub description 1",
      icon: "stubIcon1",
      temperature: {
        max: 22,
        min: 12,
      },
    },
    {
      date: 2222222,
      description: "Stub description2",
      icon: "stubIcon2",
      temperature: {
        max: 24,
        min: 13,
      },
    },
  ];
});
```

#### 2. Add snapshot testing.

Here we are making an array of stubbed forecast objects. In the test, we pass this array into the `<ForecastSummaries />` component, and use the `asFragment` method from `react-testing-library` to compare against our snapshot test, as before.

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { render } from "@testing-library/react";
import ForecastSummaries from "../../components/ForecastSummaries";

describe("ForecastSummaries", () => {
  const validProps = [
    {
      date: 1111111,
      description: "Stub description 1",
      icon: "stubIcon1",
      temperature: {
        max: 22,
        min: 12,
      },
    },
    {
      date: 2222222,
      description: "Stub description2",
      icon: "stubIcon2",
      temperature: {
        max: 24,
        min: 13,
      },
    },
  ];

  it("renders correctly", () => {
    const { asFragment } = render(<ForecastSummaries forecasts={validProps} />);
    expect(asFragment()).toMatchSnapshot();
  });
});
```

#### 3. Run the test.

You may run into an error here warning you about a failed prop in your App component. Take a look at your `App.js` and compare it with your `App.test.js`, what if anything may be missing here? 

### List testing

Next, we want to check that the array of props we've passed in is rendering the correct number of elements, which should be 2 elements with 2 versions of our props.

#### 1. Prepare `<ForecastSummary />`.

To begin with, we will need to add test ids to our `<ForecastSummary />` so we can target them to check length of the list.
Open `ForecastSummary.js` and add the following `data-testid` to outer `<div>`. We could add these attributes to each forecast detail, but we're already testing for it in `ForecastSummary.test.js`.

```jsx
const ForecastSummary = (props) => {
  const { date, icon, temperature, description } = props;

  return (
    <div className="forecast-summary" data-testid="forecast-summary">
      <div className="forecast-summary__date">{date}</div>
      <div className="forecast-summary__icon" data-testid="forecast-icon">
        {icon}
      </div>
      <div className="forecast-summary__temperature">
        {temperature.max}
        &deg;C
      </div>
      <div className="forecast-summary__description">{description}</div>
    </div>
  );
};

```

#### 2. Fix failing tests.

Once you save this, the test for `<ForecastSummaries />` should fail in the console. Think first about these questions:

- **Do you know why `<ForecastSummaries />` has failed?** Because we already had a snapshot generated, and when we added a new attribute to the `<ForecastSummary />` component that is rendered by `<ForecastSummaries />` it means the DOM fragment is different now. Update the snapshot and commit it.

- **What other tests should fail if you run them?** The test for `<ForecastSummary />`, should also fail. To fix it, just like you had for `<ForecastSummaries />` you'd need to update the snapshot.

#### 3. Test for list length.

Now we've done that, we can test that `<ForecastSummaries />` renders `<ForecastSummary />` multiple times depending on how many forecasts are in the `forecasts` array.

**Have a go at writing the tests for this yourself.**

You should use the `getAllByTestId()` and expect the length to be 2.

Let's look at how we would test this component's props:

```js
import React from "react";
import { render } from "@testing-library/react";
import ForecastSummaries from "../components/ForecastSummaries";

describe("ForecastSummaries", () => {
  const validProps = [...];

  it("renders correctly", () => {...});

  it("renders the correct number of ForecastSummary instances", () => {
    const { getAllByTestId } = render(
      <ForecastSummaries forecasts={validProps} />
    );

    expect(getAllByTestId("forecast-summary")).toHaveLength(2);
  });
});
```

What we've done here is used the `getAllByTestId()` method that is included in `react-testing-library` to find all the `data-testid`s with the value of `"forecast-summary"` within the DOM rendered from `<ForecastSummaries />`, and compiled them into an array. We then expect that array to have a length of 2 as we have passed two objects in `validProps`.

#### 4. Check tests again.

Can you see one more test that passed in the test summary in console? Good job! Now, double check tests for `<ForecastSummary />` and make amendments if needed.
