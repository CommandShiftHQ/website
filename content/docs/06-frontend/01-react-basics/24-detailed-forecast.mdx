title: "Detailed Forecast"
---

## Overview of the problem

We have one last feature we want to add to our MVP Weather App, let's take a look at our user story:

'***Users should be able to click on one of the summaries to view all of the forecasted information for that date***'

With that user story in mind, can you think of what we will need to do to achieve this? Take a minute and see if you can think of what you will need to do before reading on. 

## Requirements

1. UI should display forecast for one day in more detail.
2. All forecast summaries should have a "More details" button.
3. The detailed forecast should change when user clicks on a "More details" button.

## Technical task breakdown

To complete the first requirement we need to do a few things (we will take care of point 2 and 3 later):

1. Create a new component called `<ForecastDetails />`, this should take a single prop called `forecast`. 

2. Make the new component `<ForecastDetails />` renders the remainder of the information received - aka formatted date, min and max temperatures, humidity, wind speed and direction.

3. Write tests for this component.

4. In the `<App />` component render `<ForecastDetails />` underneath `<ForecastSummaries />` and for now let's pass it the first forecast from the list (`forecasts[0]`) as a prop.

5. Fix tests for `<App />` (a hint: check `validProps`, something might be missing there).

This time there is no walkthrough, as we're sure you can build it yourself. ðŸ’ª It's very similar to `<ForecastSummary />`.
