## Requirements

Let's check again the requirements we mentioned in the "Forecast Summary" step:

**_Users should be able to see a summary of each day of the forecast, including the date, general description, an icon for the weather that day, and maximum temperature._**

We've broken it down into two problems:

* We need to render the date, description, icon and max temperature for a day -> this was completed.
* We need to repeat this for each day of the forecast.

The second point is the next one to do!

## Technical task breakdown

We now have a single summary component. The next step of the feature we are working on is to repeat this component for each day of our forecast.

Take a look at the annotated mockup of the app we are trying to create:

![App](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/avocado-on-toast.appspot.com/o/course%2Fweather%2Fannotated-app.png?alt=media&token=d18c146e-a56f-4251-9380-1213298d5342)

The component we just made corresponds to the yellow boxes. If the whole picture represents our `<App />` component, you'll notice that the `<App />` directly contains three components (red, blue, green) - the yellow boxes are contained within the blue component.

In this challenge, we are going to make a component which does exactly that - it will be rendered inside of our `<App />` component, take the forecast list data as props, and it will use that list to render a `<ForecastSummary />` component for each item in the array.

### Instructions:
1. Create a new dummy component `<ForecastSummaries />`, give it an appropriate `className`.
2. Render an instance of this new component in `<App />`.
3. Pass the `forecasts` data to `<App />` as a prop.
4. Pass `forecasts` prop to `<ForecastSummaries />`.
5. Render a `<ForecastSummary />` component in `<ForecastSummaries />` for each entry in `forecasts` data.
6. Check the console for any errors, there might be one referring to a `key` prop. Check what you should do and fix it.
