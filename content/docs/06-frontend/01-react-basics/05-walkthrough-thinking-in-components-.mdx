## Components
Looking at the screenshot of the UI we want to build, I would say that we could break the application down into 4 logical components, like this:

![Components](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/avocado-on-toast.appspot.com/o/course%2Fweather%2Fannotated-app.png?alt=media&token=d18c146e-a56f-4251-9380-1213298d5342)

ðŸŸ¥ `<LocationDetails />` - the name and country of the city the forecast is for (red outline)

ðŸŸ¦ `<ForecastSummaries />` - a list of forecast summaries (blue outline)

ðŸŸ¨ `<ForecastSummary />` - a card with the summary of the forecast for a particular day (yellow outline)

ðŸŸ© `<ForecastDetails />` - contains the full details of the forecast for the selected day (green outline)

These components each have a clear and distinct responsibility.

## Props
In terms of props each of these components will need:

`<LocationDetails />` - the city and country that the forecast is for, so we would have a `city` and a `country` prop. These would come from the `location` object in `forecast.json`.

`<ForecastSummaries />` - a list of forecasts to summarise - so we would have a prop called `forecasts`, which would be an array - the `forecasts` attribute from `forecast.json`

`<ForecastSummary />` - details about the date, the temperature, the description and which icon it should display. So we would have `date`, `temperature`, `description` and `icon` props, which would come from the corresponding attributes in the JSON data.

`<ForecastDetails />` - details about the date, the temperature, the wind and humidity for the selected date. So we would have `date`, `temperature`, `wind` and `humidity` props. Again, this is all available in the JSON data.
