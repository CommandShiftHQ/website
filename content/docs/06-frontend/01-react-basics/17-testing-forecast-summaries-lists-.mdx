title: "Testing Forecast Summaries (lists) ðŸ”¬"
---

## Challenge

In the previous tests we have written, we have been testing components that only render basic elements. However, the `<ForecastSummaries />` component we have written doesn't do this - it renders the `<ForecastSummary />` component multiple times.

Before you start writing tests, try to answer these questions:

- What could be the most important thing to test here? Please remember that tests for particular values already have been tested.
- What should be tested first?
- What type of queries and assertions might you want use this time?

ðŸ’¡ Remember to check the [RTL docs](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro) if you're not sure what to use or how to use it.

### Instructions:

#### Snapshot testing

1. Create test file, add describe block with `validProps`.
2. Add snapshot testing.
3. Run the test for this file.

#### List testing

1. Prepare `<ForecastSummary />`.
2. Fix failing tests.
3. Test for list length.
4. Check tests again.
