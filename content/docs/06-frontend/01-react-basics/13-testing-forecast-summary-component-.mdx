## React Testing Library principles

First let's focus a bit more on React Testing Library.

This library reinforces testing UI elements, which are important to the end user. This means (in a hugely simplified way) that RTL will check if a component displays or holds values that a user can perceive, either with their sight or hearing (if someone uses a screen reader). Read this [chapter in the RTL docs](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro#this-solution) to learn more about it.

## Challenge

Having this in mind try to answer following questions:

- Which values could you test here?
- Which RTL queries will be suitable here?
- Can/Should you use the same assertions as you did in `<LocationDetails />`?
- How many tests might you need here?

Now you can either try to write tests on your own if you feel adventurous ([RTL cheatsheet](https://testing-library.com/docs/dom-testing-library/cheatsheet) can help you with that), but we would recommend checking our walkthrough for a more detailed explanation on how to approach testing.
