title: "Search - update tests 🔬"
---

## Overview

Our app is working, there are no errors in the browser console, but we need to check and update tests:

1. The test suite for `<App />` should fail, specifically the snapshot test ("renders correctly"). Look for red text: `● App › renders correctly`.
2. Our new component `<SearchForm />` has no tests. What tests would you write here?

#### 1. Fix existing tests

This one is easy, you've done it a couple of times already. 😉

#### 2. Write new tests for `<SearchForm />`

As with any testing, let's first think of what we can test, remembering some techniques/type of tests available in RTL:

- we can do snapshot testing again,
- we can check if `<button>` displays the correct text.

Can you write these tests yourself without a walkthrough?
