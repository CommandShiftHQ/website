title: "Walkthrough: Forecast Summary Component ðŸ’¡"

## Solution

Let's check to see if you got this right!

#### 1. Create relevant files.

Create two new files in the appropriate locations:
- `src/components/ForecastSummary.js`,
- `src/tests/components/ForecastSummary.test.js`.

Your dummy `<ForecastSummary />` component should look like this for now:

```jsx
import React from "react";

function ForecastSummary() {
  return <div class="forecast-summary"></div>;
};

export default ForecastSummary; 
```

Your new test file should look like this:

```
import React from "react";

describe("ForecastSummary", () => {
  it("renders", () => {});
});
```

#### 2. Expected props.

Now it's time to deconstruct the props in your new component: `date`, `temperature`, `description` and `icon`.

```jsx
import React from "react";

function ForecastSummary(props) {
  const {
    date,
    description,
    icon,
    temperature
  } = props;

  return <div class="forecast-summary"></div>;
};

export default ForecastSummary;

```

ðŸ’¡ It's good practice to list props in alphabetical order when you deconstruct them. It won't change how your application works, but will show you can write clean and organised code.

#### 3. Add markup for each forecast summary.

If you went with BEM naming convention, each forecast summary should have a class name following this pattern: `forecast-summary__**`, where `forecast-summary` is the part taken from the **block** name (here, the parent node), and `**` should be replaced with **element** name: either `date`, `icon`, `temperature`, or `description`. Now your component  should look something like this:

```jsx
function ForecastSummary(props) {
  const {
    date,
    temperature,
    description,
    icon,
  } = props;

  return (
    <div className="forecast-summary">
      <div className="forecast-summary__date">
        {date}
      </div>
      <div className="forecast-summary__icon">
        {icon}
      </div>
      <div className="forecast-summary__temperature">
        {temperature.max}
        &deg;C
      </div>
      <div className="forecast-summary__description">
        {description}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};
```
