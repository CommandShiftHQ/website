title: "Icons and Dates"
---

## Overview

The application is getting somewhere now, but it still looks a bit odd - it's not clear what the date "1525046400000" and the icon "800" mean exactly, is it?

As developers, a core part of our jobs is handling and manipulating data. As UI developers, it's our job to handle transforming that data into something more user-friendly.

## Requirements

1. Each forecast summary displays a relevant icon.
2. All dates in the app follow format: ddd Do MMM, so for example: Sun 18th Mar.

## Technical task breakdown

### Formatting the icons

The weather data we are using comes from the Open Weather API. This API provides a list of icons for each weather condition, and every response from the api provides an icon `id`. [The icons are available to see here](https://openweathermap.org/weather-conditions).

The first part of this challenge is to update the `<div>` which currently contains the icon `id` (so values like "800" or "602") in the `<ForecastSummary />` component.

To complete this part of the task:

1. Create a `json` file called iconData 
2. Create a property for each *icon group* (i.e. 200, 300 etc) detailed in the [api](https://openweathermap.org/weather-conditions).

```
{
    "200": "https://openweathermap.org/img/wn/10d@2x.png",
    "300": "https://openweathermap.org/img/wn/09d@2x.png",
    ...
}
```

3. The value for each property should be an image url, feel free to use any image you think would be suitable as an icon here.
4. Import this data into the file where you are currently rendering your icon.
5. In this file you're currently rendering the weather code to screen but you want me ensure you translate each number from an individual code into the respective code group (i.e. 230 -> 200).
6. Name the variable `weatherCode` you use to store the update `code`.
7. Once you've done this, you'll need to index `iconData` with the `weatherCode` as the `src` of an `img`.
8. You may also need to fix and update the tests for the `<ForecastSummary />` component. Feel free to include css on this step to ensure your icons are the same height and width.

### Formatting the date

As we mentioned earlier, the `date` property on our forecasts is formatted as a Unix timestamp in milliseconds - that is, the number of milliseconds since 01/01/1970 00:00:00:0000 UTC (the Unix epoch).  

Storing dates in this form makes a lot of sense - it's a consistent format, independent of timezone differences, and it makes comparing dates as simple as comparing two numbers. Unfortunately, it's less comprehensible to a human than to a computer, so we need to format it correctly in order to be able to use it.

To get a date from a unix timestamp in JavaScript, we can use the `Date` constructor - `new Date(1525046400000)`.

N.B. you can generate a unix timestamp from a `Date` using `Date.parse`

To complete this part of the task:

1. Create a variable called `formattedDate` and use the Javascript Date constructor.
2. Place the `date` variable deconstructed from the `ForecastSummary` props in the parenthesis of the Date constructor. 
If you output this value to the console, you will see a timestring.
3. So far we have a timestring but not quite in the format we want. We need to use a method available on the Date object [.toDateString()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/toDateString).
4. Replace the variable `date` within your return statement with your newly formatted date variable
5. Don't forget to update your tests to assert that a correctly formatted date is returned.
