## Solution

#### 1. Import `useState()` into the `<App />` component

`useState()` and other hooks can be imported from "react" package:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from "react";
```

#### 2. Add a `useState()` hook to your `<App />` component with its return value destructured to `selectedDate` and `setSelectedDate`. Set the initial value of `useState()` to the date of the first forecast within `forecasts` array.

Assuming that `<App />` currently looks like this:

```jsx
const App = ({ forecasts, location }) => {
  return (
    <div className="weather-app">
      <LocationDetails city={location.city} country={location.country} />
      <ForecastSummaries forecasts={forecasts} />
      <ForecastDetails forecast={forecasts[0]} />
    </div>
  );
};
```

We first need to add a useState() hook before we can add our state. We have to set the `selectedDate` property in state to the date of the first forecast from `forecasts`:

```jsx
const App = ({ forecasts, location }) => {
  const [selectedDate, setSelectedDate] = useState(forecasts[0].date);

  return (
    <div className="weather-app">
      <LocationDetails city={location.city} country={location.country} />
      <ForecastSummaries forecasts={forecasts} />
      <ForecastDetails forecast={forecasts[0]} />
    </div>
  );
};
```

#### 3. Create a `selectedForecast` variable and set it equal to the date within your `forecasts` that matches the `selectedDate`, and pass this `selectedForecast` variable into the `<ForecastDetails />` component.

Then we want to pass a `forecast` into `<ForecastDetails />` based on the selected date:

```jsx
const App = ({ forecasts, location }) => {
  const [selectedDate, setSelectedDate] = useState(forecasts[0].date);
  const selectedForecast = forecasts.find(forecast => forecast.date === selectedDate);

  return (
    <div className="weather-app">
      <LocationDetails city={location.city} country={location.country} />
      <ForecastSummaries forecasts={forecasts} />
      <ForecastDetails forecast={selectedForecast} />
    </div>
  );
};

```

Now the `<ForecastDetails />` component can render whichever forecast matches our selected date. If that date changes, then the forecast rendered in `<ForecastDetails />` will also change, but you might see an error in the command line (where you run `npm start`) or in the browser:

```plaintext
Line 9:24:  'setSelectedDate' is assigned a value but never used  no-unused-vars
```

Don't worry about it now, we will handle that in the next step.
