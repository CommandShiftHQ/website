title: "Stateful Components"
---

## Overview of the problem

At the moment our `<App />` is stateless, so to begin, convert it to a stateful component by importing `useState()` into the component.

## Requirements

The first requirement in the "Detailed Forecast" step was:

**UI should display forecast for one day in more detail.**

We used the first element in `forecasts` array to display any value. Now it's the time to display the appropriate one.

## Technical task breakdown

1. Import `useState()` into the `<App />` component.
2. Add a `useState()` hook to your `<App />` component with its return value destructured to `selectedDate` and `setSelectedDate`. Set the initial value of `useState()` to the date of the first forecast within `forecasts` array.
3. Create a `selectedForecast` variable and set its value to the date within your `forecasts` that matches the `selectedDate` (think of a function that can search through an array and return the matching value) and pass the `selectedForecast` variable into the `<ForecastDetails />` component. Don't worry if all you see is an error, we will tackle it in the next step.
