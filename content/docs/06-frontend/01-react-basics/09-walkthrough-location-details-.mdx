## Solution

#### 1. Import static data and pass it to `<App />` as a prop.

Copy the contents of the [external `forecast.json`](https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/mcrcodes/weather/forecast.json) file into a new file `src/data/forecast.json`. Then, import that into your `index.js` file. Add the following code near the top of `index.js`, under the other imports:

```js
import forecast from './data/forecast.json';
```

Since we only need the location data for this step, we are only loading that by using object destructuring.

Then pass that data into `<App />` as props:

```jsx
<App location={forecast.location} />
```

We will make use of the location prop being passed down to the `<App />` later but for now, you should have an `index.js` file that looks something like this:

```jsx
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
import "./styles/index.css";
import App from "./components/App";
import forecast from "./data/forecast.json";

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
root.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App location={forecast.location} />
  </React.StrictMode>,
);
```

#### 2. Create a new file `LocationDetails.js` in your components directory.

The first step of the challenge is to create a file `src/components/LocationDetails.js`.

#### 3. Create a component called `<LocationDetails />` with `<h1>` tag displaying city and country.

Firstly, you will need to import React into the file - this is done in the same way we've already seen in the other files at the top of the file:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
```

Remember, that a React component is just a JavaScript function, which receives `props`, and returns some JSX. In our case, we want to render a `<h1>` element with the appropriate class name.

We said this component would take 2 props (`city` and `country`) to match our component design. We want to render these inside of the component:

```jsx
function LocationDetails(props) {
  const { city, country } = props;
  return <h1>{`${city}, ${country}`}</h1>;
};
```

ðŸ’¡ Note that in React if an element has no child elements, it should be self-closing (as opposed to having an opening and closing tag, like `<div></div>`). The example below is not related to our Weather App design, but should give you an idea how to do it in the future:

```jsx
function MyComponent(props) {
  const { customClassName } = props;
  return <div className={customClassName} />;
}
```

Finally, you need to export the `<LocationDetails />` component from the file. At the very bottom of the file, add the following:

```jsx
export default LocationDetails; 
```

#### 4. Import the `<LocationDetails />` component into `App.js`.

Now you are ready to use it in your App component. 
To do this, you need to import it into `App.js`. After the other imports in that file, add the line:

```jsx
import LocationDetails from './LocationDetails';
```

#### 5. Update the `<App />` component, so that it renders `<LocationDetails />` using JSX.

Now change `<App />` to look like this:

```jsx
function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <LocationDetails />
    </div>
  );
};
```

#### 6. Pass `props.location.city` and `props.location.country` from `<App />` into `<LocationDetails />`.

If you check your app in your browser, you should see "undefined, undefined"! If you check the DOM in dev tools, you should see that your `h1` element HAS been rendered. If you then check the console tab, you should see a warning, thats says `city` and `country` are required, but their value is `undefined`.

To fix this, we need to pass those props in from `<App />`. The data we want to pass in is in the location data from the JSON file, and we have made that available to `<App />` as the `location` prop.

So, using the props on `<App />`, we can pass that data into `<LocationDetails />`:

```jsx
function App(props) {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <LocationDetails city={props.location.city} country={props.location.country} />
    </div>
  );
};
```

With JSX if our props start to get quite long like this, it is possible to split it onto multiple lines for improved readability:

```jsx
function App(props) {
  const { location } = props;
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <LocationDetails city={location.city} country={location.country} />
    </div>
  );
};
```

If you want to improve readability even further you can first deconstruct props in the function params, then deconstruct `location` for a second time in the function block:

```jsx
function App({ location }) {
  const {city, country} = location;
  return (
    <LocationDetails
      city={city}
      country={country}
    />
  );
};
```

ðŸ¤” At the moment, it might seem pretty pointless to have the app structured like this - just rendering a single component - but as the app grows, it will become more apparent why we are structuring it this way. The App component will act as a layout, and a central place for managing our application data. It delegates responsibility for displaying that data to the other components.
 
Once you've done that, you are done! Check the browser, and you should see the city details being rendered - if you update them in the JSON file, it should update in the browser.
