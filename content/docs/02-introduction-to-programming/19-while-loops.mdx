- Understand how to write a while-loop in JavaScript
- Understand how to stop a while-loop

## While Loops

We use **for-loops** we want to perform a task a fixed number of times. These loops are based on a counter, which counts how many times the action has been performed.

On other occasions, we might want to keep repeating an action **until** we no longer need to and these situations don't always depend on a counter, but on some other factor.

A classic example would be in a game where the user is asked a question and has to guess the answer. If they get the question wrong, they have to guess again, and keep guessing until they get the answer right.

In this scenario, we don't know how many attempts the user will take to guess correctly, and there is no way we could calculate it beforehand, so a for-loop wouldn't be able to solve our problem.

Thankfully, this is the kind of problem we can use a **while-loop** to solve.

These are similar to for-loops, and actually a little bit simpler to understand!

### While Loops in JavaScript

A simple while loop would look like this:

```js
let shouldKeepLooping = true;
while(shouldKeepLooping) {
  console.log('Do something');
  shouldKeepLooping = false;
}
```

The syntax here is very similar to an if-statement. We create the while-loop using the `while` keyword. In the round brackets we have a simple condition, which should be a boolean expression. Finally there is the block of code that we want to loop over.

We've already said that for-loops depend on a counter and while-loops do not. This means there is a practical difference when we write the two kinds of loops.

A while loop doesn't depend on any particular thing. The condition expression we use to control the loop - and the values used by this expression - could be *anything* and we need to manage these values as part of the loop.

Lets see a practical illustration of this using the simple example above.

The code block we want to execute is a `console.log` statement.

```js
{
  console.log('Do something');
}
```

To execute this block four times, we could use a for-loop:

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 4; i += 1) {
  console.log('Do something');
}
```

But if we put wanted to use a while-loop to execute the same code-block until the value of our `shouldKeepLooping` variable was false, we would have a problem:

```js
let shouldKeepLooping = true;
while (shouldKeepLooping) {
  console.log('Do something');
}
```

In the example above, the condition that controls the loop depends on the value of the `shouldKeepLooping` variable - the loop will keep running until the value of that variable is `false`. But the code block doesn't change the value of that variable, so the loop will run forever.


Step-by-step, the process is this:

- `shouldKeepLooping` starts as `true`
- before running the code block, the loop checks the value of `shouldKeepLooping`
- `shouldKeepLooping` is `true` therefore the loop executes the code block
  - the message is printed
- before running the code block again, the loop checks the value of `shouldKeepLooping`
- `shouldKeepLooping` is still `true` therefore the loop executes the code block
  - the message is printed
- before running the code block again, the loop checks the value of `shouldKeepLooping`
- `shouldKeepLooping` is still `true` therefore the loop executes the code block
  - the message is printed
- ...repeat this forever

With while-loops, it's really important that the code you are looping over will at some point cause the loop to stop. That's why we have to include the extra statement `shouldKeepLooping = false` - to stop the loop.

```js
let shouldKeepLooping = true;
while (shouldKeepLooping) {
  console.log('Do something');
  shouldKeepLooping = false;
}
```

Now the step-by-step process is this:

- `shouldKeepLooping` starts as `true`
- before running the code block, the loop checks the value of `shouldKeepLooping`
- `shouldKeepLooping` is `true` therefore the loop executes the code block
  - the message is printed
  - `shouldKeepLooping` is set to false
- before running the code block again, the loop checks the value of `shouldKeepLooping`
- `shouldKeepLooping` is now `false` therefore the loop stops

### Example - Guessing Game

Let's take a look at a more real-life example now, using the guessing game scenario we mentioned before.

We will write a simple program that asks the user to guess the name of the capital city of Paraguay (Asuncion).

We can do this by using `prompt`:

```js
const guess = prompt('What is the capital city of Paraguay?');
```

When the user provides an answer, we want to tell them if they were right or wrong. We can use `alert` to send a message to the user, and we can use an if/else statement to decide which message to send:

```js
const userGuess = prompt('What is the capital of Paraguay?')

if (userGuess === 'Asuncion') {
  alert('Congratulations, you guessed correctly!');
} else {
  alert('Uh oh, you guessed incorrectly!');
}
```

This code works, but it will only ask the user once. To make the user guess repeatedly until the answer correctly, we need to use a while-loop. The step-by-step process we need for this loop looks like this:

- we will create a variable `hasGuessedCorrectly`, which is begins as the value `false`
- before running the code block, the loop should check the value of `hasGuessedCorrectly`
- if the user has not guessed correctly, the loop will do the following:
  - ask the user to make a guess
  - check if the guess is correct and use this to update the `hasGuessedCorrectly` variable
  - display a message to the user

```js
let hasGuessedCorrectly = false;

while (!hasGuessedCorrectly) {
  const userGuess = prompt('What is the capital of Paraguay?')

  hasGuessedCorrectly = (userGuess === 'Asuncion');

  if (hasGuessedCorrectly) {
    alert('Congratulations, you guessed correctly!');
  } else {
    alert('Uh oh, you guessed incorrectly!');
  }
}
```

When we run this code, the user will be asked the question repeatedly until they get the answer right - it could be once, twice, or 10000 times. 
With a for-loop, we could have asked the user a set number of times, but with a while-loop, we can be a little bit smarter.
