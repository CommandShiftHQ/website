title: "Strings"
---

Let's get started with passing the first test. In `__tests__/strings.test.js` change the first `xit` to `it`:

```js
it('returns "Hello, world!" when passed "world"', (done) => {
```

Once you've done that, save the file and run the tests again:

You should see the test failing:

```bash
    expect(received).toEqual(expected) // deep equality

    Expected: 200
    Received: 404

       8 |         .get('/strings/hello/world')
       9 |         .then(res => {
    > 10 |           expect(res.status).toEqual(200);
         |                              ^
      11 |           expect(res.body).toEqual({ result: 'Hello, world!' });
      12 |           done();
      13 |         });

      at __tests__/strings.test.js:10:30
```

So why has that happened? Lets take a look at the test itself:

```js
/* tests/strings.test.js */
it('returns "Hello, world!" when passed "world"', done => {
  request(app)
    .get('/strings/hello/world')
    .then(res => {
      expect(res.status).toEqual(200);
      expect(res.body).toEqual({ result: 'Hello, world!' });
      done();
    });
});
```

- We make a request to the `app` (`app` is our Express instance that we import at the top of the test file)
- More specifically, we make a GET request to `/strings/hello/world`
- `.get` sends the request
- `.then` sends us back a response from the server
- When the response comes back, we assert that the response has a status code of 200

This is where our test is currently failing. Our test expected a HTTP status code of 200, but has received a 404 - do you know what this means?

If you said *'404 NOT FOUND!'* - then well done.

If you said *'It means our Express server doesn't know how to handle GET requests sent to `/strings/hello/world`!'* - then an even bigger well done.

To fix this error, we will need to configure our first **route**

## Express

**Read** the [:books: Express Hello World example](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/hello-world.html)

The entry point of our Express application is `index.js` - take a look in this file:

```js
/* index.js */
const app = require('./src/app');

const APP_PORT = 3000;

app.listen(APP_PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Now serving your Express app at http://localhost:${APP_PORT}`); // eslint-disable-line
});
```

Not a lot going on here - we are importing an `app` object, and calling the `listen` method.  

So what is `app`? To find out, we should look in `src/app.js`:

```js
/* src/app.js */
const express = require('express');

const app = express();

module.exports = app;
```

This file is the main file where we configure and export our server.

As we can see, `app` is an `express` application - when we call the `express` function, it returns to us an application that we can configure (although we haven't done any configuration to it yet).

In `index.js` we just call the `listen` method on the `app` object - this actually starts the server - it tells the server to listen on the given port (`3000`).

The reason we have these in two files is to separate the configuration of the server from the running of the server. This is so we can either:

- Fire up the server locally (with `npm start`), which will allow us to make requests to our server in the browser or [Postman](https://www.postman.com).

- Pass our Express instance (`app`) to `supertest`, which will fire up its own server to test our routes. This is great as it means we don't have to have a server running to run our tests...`supertest` does it all for us :nerd_face:.

## Creating a route

**Read** the [:books: Express docs on Routing](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html)

When working with Express, we can view a lot of what we do as configuration - instead of writing a load of code ourselves, we are using the handy methods provided by Express to tell the server how to respond to different requests.

By default, Express will respond to ALL requests with a 404 - the reason for this is because we need to tell Express how it should respond to different requests.

We know that HTTP requests are made up of two fundamental parts - the **METHOD** (GET/POST/PUT etc) and the PATH (`/images/1234/comments`). These are the main things that Express will consider when figuring how to deal with a request.

The process of configuring Express to handle different requests with different methods and paths is called routing.

An example of registering a route is as follows:

```js
/* src/app.js */
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello, world!');
});
```

Here, the app responds with “Hello, world!” for GET requests to the path `/` (called the root URL). For every other path, it will respond with a 404.

**Read** the [:books: Express docs on the `app` object](https://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#app)

`app` is our express application. It has a `get` method that routes HTTP GET requests to the path specified in the first parameter (`/` in our case). The second parameter is a callback function called a **route handler** or more commonly a **controller** function.

The controller function is invoked by Express when it receives a request to the given route.

Controller functions have two parameters `req` (which represents the http request that was sent) and `res` which represents the response we will send.

**Read** the [:books: Express docs on the `res` object](https://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#res)

We will look at `req` shortly.  

In this case we are using the `send` method on the `res` object to send a response to the client. We are just sending the string `Hello, world`.

## Challenge

Can you register a route in your Express app that handles `GET` requests to `/strings/hello/world`? The controller function should use the `res.status()` method to send back a 200 status code, as required by the test.

Don't forget to take a look at the documentation links above if you get stuck.

### :exclamation: Reminder

Never spend more than 30 minutes stuck on a problem. Ask a member of the Command Shift Team - or one of your peers - for assistance in your cohort's Slack channel or via a DM.

***

Run the tests again. If your code is correct, you should now get a different error message. Don't despair - this is progress!

You should have an error message like this:

```bash
    expect(received).toEqual(expected) // deep equality

    - Expected
    + Received

    - Object {
    -   "result": "Hello, world!",
    - }
    + Object {}

       9 |         .then(res => {
      10 |           expect(res.status).toEqual(200);
    > 11 |           expect(res.body).toEqual({ result: 'Hello, world!' });
         |                            ^
      12 |           done();
      13 |         });
      14 |     });

      at __tests__/strings.test.js:11:28
```

A look at the tests to see what's wrong now:

```js
/* tests/strings.test.js */
expect(res.body).toEqual({ result: 'Hello, world!' });
```

This is saying that the we should have received some data in the body of the response - an object `{ result: 'Hello, world!' }`

## Challenge

Can you update the controller function you wrote earlier to send the required JSON data to make the test pass? Use the documentation above to help you.

If you've done everything correctly then your first test should now be passing...congratulations!

### Extra credit

Fire up your server locally with `npm start` and use Postman to visit your new route. 

Hint: http://localhost:3000/your-route-goes-here
