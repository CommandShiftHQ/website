title: "Challenge: Strings"
---

Your challenge in this step is to create the endpoints for the remaining tests in `strings.test.js` without a walkthrough to guide you. Use the previous solutions to guide you, and add more tests if you feel they are necessary. 

Don't forget, you need to un-skip each test as you go by changing `xit` to `it`!

**There is one caveat** - for the first-characters endpoint, you will need to make use of the req.query object to handle query string parameters...

- **Recap** the [:books: Express docs on the `req` object](https://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#res)
- **Read** the [:books: Express docs on the `req.query` object](https://expressjs.com/en/api.html#req.query)

Good luck!
