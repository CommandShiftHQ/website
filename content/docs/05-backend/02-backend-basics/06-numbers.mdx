By now you should be familiar with passing strings as route parameters, and sending responses based on those parameters.

The first tests in the numbers test suite are similar to those we have already seen:

```js
/* tests/numbers.test.js */
describe('GET /add/{number}/and/{number}', () => {
  xit('adds 2 and 1', done => {
    request(app)
      .get('/numbers/add/2/and/1')
      .then(res => {
        expect(res.status).toEqual(200);
        expect(res.body).toEqual({ result: 3 });
        done();
      });
  });
  ...
});
```

Remember, you'll need to change `xit` to `it` here for the tests to catch it (and you should at this point have a failing test).

## Challenge

You can solve this in a way now which you should be comfortable with. You'll add a new endpoint to your `app.js` file, defining two path parameters, and using the `add` function from your `numbers` JS basics module to help formulate your response.

Note that your code probably won't pass the test the first time. You might get a response back of 21...can you think why this might be?

### Extra credit

You should know by now... try it in Postman!
