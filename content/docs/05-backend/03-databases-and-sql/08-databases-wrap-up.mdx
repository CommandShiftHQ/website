# Wrap-up and Materials
Fantastic! 

You've made it this far, got familiar with docker containers and practiced some SQL by querying the movies database. 

**üí° Remember: Docker containers can be re-created at any time.**

So don't fret that you've just dropped the entire DB in the DELETE exercises, you can always go back and try again.
