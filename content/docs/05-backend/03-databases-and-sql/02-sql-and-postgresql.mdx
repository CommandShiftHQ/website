## What is SQL?

SQL (either pronounced *"ess-que-el"* or *"sequel"*) stands for *"Structured Query Language"*. It is the most wide-spread language for interacting with `relational databases`. We can use it to do things like adding entries to a database, reading information, deleting entries and, if misused, whole tables and databases.

## What is a Relational Database?
A `relational database` is a database that stores and provides access to pieces of information that are related to each other in some way.

## What is PostgreSQL?

PostgreSQL is a `relational database management system`. Specifically a free and open-source database platform. There is a range of systems available, both `SQL` and `NoSQL`. `NoSQL` databases are simply databases that do not use `SQL` as a means to interact with them.

### Common SQL Databases
- PostgreSQL
- MySQL
- SQLite

### Common NoSQL Databases
- MongoDB
- DynamoDB
