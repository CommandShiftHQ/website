# Update Exercises

These exercises require you to update existing records in the `keywords`, `person` and `movie` tables from Movies database. You will need to use [UPDATE](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/postgresql/postgresql_update_query.htm) statement. This makes use of the `UPDATE`, `SET` and `WHERE` keywords.


**ðŸ’¡Remember**:
If you make a mistake you can always remove the container and start a new one.

1. Write a statement to change the name of `terror` keyword to `horror`.
1. Write a statement to change the all the keywords `horror` to `secret keyword`. 
1. Write a statement to change `name` of the person `RZA` to `Robert Fitzgerald Diggs`.
1. Write a statement to change the `homepage` of all the movies with a revenue higher than 1m to the Wikipedia page for Avatar - The Way of Water. 

Now that we've wrecked these tables, let's look at the `production_company` and `movie` tables:

1. The production company behind `Forrest Gump` movie recently changed their name. They have requested that we update the company name to `Paramount+`.

1. They also requested that you change all homepages for the movies that they produced to the Paramount+ streaming service. 

You will have to check the `movie_company` table to see which movie ids correspond to the desired production company. 
Extra points if you complete this exercise using a `JOIN` statement (as opposed to multiple SELECTs).
