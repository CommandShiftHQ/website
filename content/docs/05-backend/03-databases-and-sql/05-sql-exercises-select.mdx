# Read Exercises

These exercises all require you to read data from the `movies` table. To do this, you will need to use the [SELECT](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/postgresql/postgresql_select_query.htm) keyword. 

For more advanced queries, you will also need to use:

 - The [WHERE](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/postgresql/postgresql_where_clause.htm) keyword and get familiar on how to use it in [expressions](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/postgresql/postgresql_expressions.htm)
 - [Built-in SQL functions](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/postgresql/postgresql_useful_functions.htm).
 - [GROUP BY](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/postgresql/postgresql_group_by.htm) keyword to group results
