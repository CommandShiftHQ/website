title: "Introduction to Databases"
---

This week, we'll be learning about databases. We'll start with a brief overview of `relational databases`, and how we can use `SQL` to send instructions to them. We will look at some of the different platforms you can host a database on, such as `PostgreSQL`. Finally we will have an introduction to `Docker`, and use it to run a pre-made database on our computers.

## Learning objectives

- Can you explain what a database is?

- What is the difference between a primary key and a foreign key?
