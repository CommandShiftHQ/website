title: "Project Setup "
---

In light of our requirements, we know that we will need to cater for *at least* two data structures - **Reader** and **Book**, with the corresponding controllers, routes and tests.

## Getting set up

We are going to set up an `express` app which uses `Sequelize` to interact with a `Postgres` database. The steps assume you have `Postgres` running in a `docker` container on your machine. It also references the `music-library-api`. If you get stuck, it would be a good idea to check back there for examples.

We will start by setting up the repository, a basic express app and a mocha/chai/supertest test suite.

### Repository Setup
1. Create a new directory for the project on your computer

1. Create a new `README.md` file in the root of your project

1. Initialise a git repo in the new directory with `git init`

1. Add an empty `.gitignore` file

1. Create a repository for the project on Github

1. Connect your local repository to the remote GitHub repository

1. Initialise a new `NPM` project in your project directory with `npm init`

1 Add `node_modules` to your `.gitignore` file

## Application Setup

1. Install `express`, and `pg` as dependencies

1. Set up your basic `index.js` and `src/app.js` similar to how you did in the `Music API` project
    1. `src/app.js` should configure and export a basic Express application.
    1. `index.js` should call `app.listen()` and then `console.log()` the port that the app is listening on.

1. Install `dotenv` and `nodemon` as development dependencies

1. Add a `start` script to your `package.json` file with the following command: `nodemon -r dotenv/config index.js`. This uses `nodemon` to execute the `index.js` file with the environment variables loaded from a `.env` file.

1. Create a scripts folder, and copy the `create-database.js` and `drop-database.js` scripts from the `music-library`. Your `create database` script only needs to create the database. We will use `Sequelize` to handle setting up our tables.

1. Add a `prestart` script to your `package.json`. Set the command to `node scripts/create-database.js`. This will run before the `npm start` command, and will create your database if it doesn't already exist.

1. Create a `.env` file with the following variables:

```
    PGPASSWORD=password
    PGDATABASE=book_library_dev
    PGUSER=postgres
    PGHOST=localhost
    PGPORT=5433
```

At this point you should be able to run `npm start` in your terminal, and get a listening express server.

## Test Environment Setup
1. Install `mocha`, `chai`, and `supertest` as dev dependencies.

1. Copy across the `test-setup.js` from the `music-library-api`

1. Add a `.env.test` with the same environment variables as your `.env`. Make sure to give your test database a different name.

1. Add `.env.test` to your `.gitignore`

1. Add a `test` script to your `package.json` file: `mocha tests/**/*.js --exit --recursive --timeout 60000 --file ./tests/test-setup.js`

1. Add a `pretest` script to your `package.json`. Set the command to: `node scripts/create-database.js test`. Note that this time we pass the `test` option at the end of the command. This tells the script to load the variables from `.env.test` instead of `.env`.

1. Add a `posttest` script, set the command to: `node scripts/drop-database.js test`. This will delete your test database after your tests have finished running.

At this point, you should be able to run `npm test` in your terminal. Mocha should run and inform you that there are no tests yet. Commit your work to Github.
