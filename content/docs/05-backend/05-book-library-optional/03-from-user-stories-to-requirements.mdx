title: "From User Stories to Requirements"
---

We can use our user stories to come up with a list of requirements:

**User Stories 1-4**

```
Reader:
	- name: String
	- email: String
		* Check if email address is valid
	- password: String
		* Check if password is at least 8 characters long

```

**User Stories 5-8**

```
Book:
	- title: String
		* Check if title exists
	- author: String
		* Check if author exists
	- genre: String
	- ISBN: String
```

**From all user stories**

```
Actions:
	* Do not return password from API
	* Want to be able to have list of all the books
	* Want to be able to search by each of the fields above
```


* These initial requirements are driven by user stories, however, can you think of any others? 

* As a database admin can you think of any other conditions you would like to have in order to keep data consistent?
	* ðŸ¤” For instance, would it make sense to allow a Reader to create an account without checking if name, email or password exist?
