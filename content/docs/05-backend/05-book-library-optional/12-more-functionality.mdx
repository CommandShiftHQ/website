title: "More functionality"
---

On the actions list in our requirements, we have:

```
Actions:
	* Do not return password from API
	* Want to be able to have list of all the books
	* Want to be able to search by each of the fields above
```

## Task
Go ahead and implement the functionality of *never* returning a password from a user:

- This will apply to four controllers

```
1. GET /readers
2. GET /readers/:id
3. POST /readers
4. PATCH /readers/:id
```

-  Don't forget to update/add to your tests so this new functionality is tested.

- You can find our solution [here](https://github.com/MCRcodes/book-library-api/commit/238c41c6c774948bf29b845d39b984731d8f13a4)
