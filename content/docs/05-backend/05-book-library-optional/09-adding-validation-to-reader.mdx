title: "Adding Validation to Reader"
---

Now that we have `Reader` and `Book` created, it’s time that we add some validation to the data we‘re sending to/from our database.

## **WHAT** is validation?
In a nutshell, it's the capability of being able to validate data before it is handled and/or captured. On server side projects, validation is particularly important as protection against malicious users, without which they could submit dangerous input to the server.

There’s a few main types of validation that are very useful to us as developers:

1. that something* exists
2. that something* isn’t empty
3. that something* matches a rule
			
*`something` being a data structure

## **WHERE** to add validation? 
The place where we should add validation in our application is where we define what data we save/retrieve to/from our database, eg in our models.

## **HOW** to add validation?
Sequelize provides us with a number of out-of-the-box validation functions and constraints. We have used the `DataTypes` object before, and in itself this is a validation of the `type` that is used for a model field. 

Sequelize does give us more power than that, which you can have a look at here: [Sequelize - Pre-attribute validations](https://sequelize.org/master/manual/validations-and-constraints.html).

## Task
Referring to the Sequelize documentation above, validate fields in our Model according to our requirements:

```
Reader:
	- name:  String
	- email:  String
		* Check if email address is valid
	- password: String
		* Check if password is at least 8 characters long
```

### Note:
1. In Sequelize the following:

```js
  const schema = {
    email: DataTypes.STRING,
    name: DataTypes.STRING,
    password: DataTypes.STRING,
  };
```
can be written as:

```js
  const schema = {
    email: {
      type: DataTypes.STRING,
    },
    name: {
      type: DataTypes.STRING,
    },
    password: {
      type: DataTypes.STRING,
    },
  };
```
which allows us to expand what we're matching each Model field against.

2. Make sure that `name`, `email` and `password` exist and cannot be empty

3. Make sure that `email` is in the correct format

4. Make sure `password` is longer than 8 characters

5. Make sure the controller knows how to handle the different error messages the model might throw.

6. Don't forget to write tests that support this functionality
