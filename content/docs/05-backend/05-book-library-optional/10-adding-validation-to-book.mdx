title: "Adding Validation to Book"
---

Now that we've added validation to the `Reader` model, our next task is to add validation to `Book`. 
In this case we just want to make sure that we have an author and a title.

```	
Book:
	- title: String
		* Check if title exists
	- author: String
		* Check if author exists
	- genre: String
	- ISBN: String
```

1. Make sure constraints and validation are added to the `Book` model.
2. Make sure the controller knows how to handle the different error messages the model might throw.
3. Write unit tests that make sure that this functionality is in place.
