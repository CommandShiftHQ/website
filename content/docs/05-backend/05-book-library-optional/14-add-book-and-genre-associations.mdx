title: "Add Book and Genre associations"
---

Now that we have `genre` and `author` in their own tables we want to be able to associate those two tables via a foreign key.

This is made easy by Sequelize, as using its associations `hasOne`, `hasMany`, `belongsTo` and `belongsToMany` infers foreign key relationships between tables.

Using `genre` as a starting point, the Genre model should look like this (notice that there is no reference to books in the model!):

```js
module.exports = (connection, DataTypes) => {
  const schema = {
    genre: {
      allowNull: false,
      type: DataTypes.STRING,
      unique: true,
      validate: {
        notNull: {
          args: [true],
          msg: 'We need a genre',
        },
        notEmpty: {
          args: [true],
          msg: 'The genre cannot be empty',
        },
      },
    },
  };

  return connection.define('Genre', schema);
};

```
1 - We should remove any reference to `genre` in the Book model, so it should now look like similar to: 

```js
module.exports = (connection, DataTypes) => {
  const schema = {
    title: {
      allowNull: false,
      type: DataTypes.STRING,
      validate: {
        notNull: {
          args: [true],
          msg: 'We need a book title',
        },
        notEmpty: {
          args: [true],
          msg: 'The book title cannot be empty',
        },
      },
    },
    author: {
      type: DataTypes.STRING,
      allowNull: false,
      validate: {
        notNull: {
          args: [true],
          msg: 'We need a book author',
        },
        notEmpty: {
          args: [true],
          msg: 'The book author cannot be empty',
        },
      },
    },
    ISBN: DataTypes.STRING,
  };

  return connection.define('Book', schema);
};

```

2 - We will make our associations in our Sequelize setup file in `/src/models/index.js` by adding the following code immediately after where we define the constants `Reader`, `Book` and `Genre`:

```js
  Reader.hasMany(Book);
  Genre.hasMany(Book);
  Book.belongsTo(Genre);
```

3 - After setting the relationships above, Sequelize will automatically create the foreign key for `GenreId` in the Books table, so you don't need to do it yourself. Therefore Book will have a new column named `GenreId` (notice the capitalisation). This means if we have a `row` on `genres` with the value 


```js
{
  id: 3,
  genre: "Travel Literature"
}
```

We could create a new book with the following JSON:

```js
{
  "title": "In Patagonia",
  "author": "Bruce Chatwin",
  "GenreId": 3
}
```

More on associations in the (very good) Sequelize [documentation](https://sequelize.org/master/manual/assocs.html). 

4 - Query using Sequelize associations. Let's imagine that upon the creation of our book above we got back an `id` of `10`. If we query our database with `/books/10` we'll see that there's no mention to genre besides a `GenreId` integer which, for a human, does not give us much information.

In order to get the genre beyond an `id` we will need to make sure that our query for Book includes the model Genre. If you change the code of `getItemById` in `/src/controllers/helpers.js` so that it looks like this:

```js
const getItemById = (res, model, id) => {
  const Model = getModel(model);

  return Model.findByPk(id, { include: Genre }).then((item) => {
    if (!item) {
      res.status(404).json(get404Error(model));
    } else {
      const itemWithoutPassword = removePassword(item.dataValues);

      res.status(200).json(itemWithoutPassword);
    }
  });
};
```

and try the endpoint again, what do you see? 

It should return something similar to:

```js
{
    "id": 10,
    "title": "In Patagonia",
    "author": "Bruce Chatwin",
    "ISBN": null,
    "createdAt": "2020-05-23T11:25:03.000Z",
    "updatedAt": "2020-05-23T11:25:03.000Z",
    "GenreId": 3,
    "Genre": {
        "id": 3,
        "genre": "Travel Literature",
        "createdAt": "2020-05-23T11:24:05.000Z",
        "updatedAt": "2020-05-23T11:24:05.000Z"
    }
}

```

5 - This is all very good, but what about querying a genre so that it shows us all the books listed under it, which is what our requirements asked of us? At the moment if we hit the `/genres` endpoint it would only shows us a list of genres with no books details.

For that we will need to add a new `getAllBooks` function in `/src/controllers/helpers.js` so that it includes our Book model, like so:

```js
const getAllBooks = (res, model) => {
  const Model = getModel(model);

  return Model.findAll({ include: Book }).then((items) => {
    res.status(200).json(items);
  });
};
```

Try the endpoint again. We should see something to:

```js
    {
        "id": 3,
        "genre": "Travel Literature",
        "createdAt": "2020-05-23T11:24:05.000Z",
        "updatedAt": "2020-05-23T11:24:05.000Z",
        "Books": [
            {
                "id": 10,
                "title": "In Patagonia",
                "author": "Bruce Chatwin",
                "ISBN": null,
                "createdAt": "2020-05-23T11:25:03.000Z",
                "updatedAt": "2020-05-23T11:25:03.000Z",
                "GenreId": 3
            }
        ]
    },
    {
        "id": 4,
        "genre": "Science Fiction",
        ....
```
