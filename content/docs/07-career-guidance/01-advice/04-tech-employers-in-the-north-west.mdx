Here's a list of tech employers based in the North West. If you know any that are missing, please do let us know so we can add them to the list.

## Looking for Junior roles

Some software developer vacancies specify in the description "suitable for junior", so don't just look for vacancies with Junior in the title. Also look for "Graduate" opportunities as you may be considered. High salary ranges (e.g. £20,000 - £40,000) can also indicate willingness to take on juniors (though do check). If a role doesn't mention any of these, then ask the company before you proceed to apply, as they might not be in a place where they can take juniors on, and you don't want to waste your time. 

It's worth mentioning that the companies below might not hire juniors, and we can't vouch for every one being a great place to work.
