title: "Writing a Cover Letter"

## Checklist

- [ ] If you can, find out who the person is responsible for hiring at the company you're applying for, and address your cover letter to them. Failing this, use 'To whom it may concern,'.
- [ ] Tell them why you want to work there.
- [ ] Tell them what makes you qualified for the role.
- [ ] Let them know your availability for interview.

## Insight into you
Your cover letter should give the employer a bit more of an insight into you and your personality than your CV can. You should take the opportunity to truly demonstrate your passion for the company and the role in question. The cover letter will help the employer to gage whether you will fit into the organisation's culture.

## Passion for the company
The person assessing your application will likely be very fond of their employer. By demonstrating your passion for the employer also (do your research), you can impress.

## Suitability for the role

The cover letter is largely a box ticking exercise for a role's requirements. You should ensure that you cover all of the bases with examples. If you don't meet a requirement then that isn't necessarily the end of the world (it's very rare that anybody does) but you should clarify this and demonstrate a willingness to learn.

## Write the CV first

Your cover letter is an extra layer on top of your CV, and your CV will undoubtedly help to guide you in writing this.

## Different employer, different cover letter

Unlike your CV, you should write a different cover letter for each employer you apply to. It should very much be about the company and the role you're applying for.
