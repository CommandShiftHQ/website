title: "Writing a CV"

## Essential!!!

* [ ] Link to GitHub
* [ ] You should mention your experience with Manchester Codes.
* [ ] Previous education is only relevant if you've done a Computer Science degree (if you have then this is important) or you have certifications from Microsoft, Google, Amazon etc that would be relevant to a developer role. If not, then leave Education until the end of your CV.
* [ ] Your CV should be no longer than 2 pages.
* [ ] Spelling and grammar is important. Have somebody proofread for you.
* [ ] Avoid buzzwords at all costs - [give this a read](https://www.reed.co.uk/career-advice/what-words-should-i-use-on-my-cv/) - words that show achievement are generally to be recommended.
* [ ] Your CV should be tailored to the role and company you are applying for BUT you shouldn't mention the company. Don't write a new CV every time - just modify it for each role.
* [ ] A CV is a place to really sell yourself. Don't hold back.
* [ ] If you have development experience in any language or have worked with databases before in some capacity, then this is just as important as your time on the course.

## Opening Paragraph

Your opening paragraph is your chance to impress and to grasp the attention of the person reading your CV. It could very quickly land you in the rejected pile, so you should spend time getting it right. Read it out loud, and imagine how it would be perceived by the person reading it. 

You should say:

* Where you are at in your journey: "I'm a Junior Developer with knowledge across the full-stack, looking to specialise and further develop my knowledge on the front-end."
* What are you strongest at? "I'm most confident working with React in a test-driven manner".
* What are you looking for in the company? Note this should be somewhat tailored to the company you are applying at. If you're applying at an agency with quite a progressive culture, then say you're looking for strong working culture and team spirit. If you're looking at a more corporate role, then you might want to think about passion for learning and development and future progression.
* Why should they hire you? Again, avoid buzzwords here. "I'm looking for a role where I can continue to grow my skill-set, where I'll have the opportunity to have a real impact."

## Portfolio

It's highly likely that you don't have previous development experience which is fine. Your CV should therefore sell your experience on the course first and foremost. You should use the STAR approach to demonstrate your technical competence to potential employers. STAR is short for Situation, Task, Activity, Result:

* Situation - what was your role?
* Task - what problem were you trying to solve?
* Acitivity - how did you solve the problem?
* Result - what was the outcome?

This should still be short and concise.

An example: "As the person responsible for API development on our team, I had to create an endpoint that would aggregate data. After some research, I used MongoDB to achieve this. The outcome was more performant aggregation of data, and I learnt about more advanced MongoDB concepts."

This demonstrates that you're hungry to learn, that you already know the basic MongoDB concepts and that you have experience with API development.

This could sit under a specific project heading or it could be worded more broadly into your opening paragraph.

## Education

If you have a degree then make this the focal point.

If you have any technical certifications these should also stand out.

Noteworthy A-Levels would be anything STEM related (Science, Technology, Engineering, Maths). 

The only noteworthy GCSEs to mention here are English and Maths. Generally make this quite concise: A in English, B in Maths. If it's not A-C then don't mention it. 

## Work Experience

Though your previous work experience may not have been in the development field, that doesn't mean it's irrelevant. Use the work experience section to demonstrate how driven you have been in previous roles, the results you have achieved and the traits that have come with those positions.

## Technologies

This shouldn't just be a bullet point list, and you shouldn't go mad (use this as a box ticking exercise for the technologies being asked for in the job spec). You should demonstrate knowledge of these technologies so back up with examples. "I have a good knowledge of Test-Driven development - I have previously tested modules with the Jest library, and have used Enzyme to test React components".

## Skills

It's common to have a Skills section that gives an insight into your abilities outside of coding. This should still be backed up with strong examples. E.g. If you mention that you have good leadership skills, then tell the employer about a time when you led a team and why it was successful under your leadership.

## Interests

This is optional, but it's often nice to give employers a little bit of an insight to you as a person. Anything that shows you are active is generally good. As is anything that shows you are a bit quirky/edgy so any niche interests might be worth a mention. Again, this is dependent on who you're applying for / their culture.
