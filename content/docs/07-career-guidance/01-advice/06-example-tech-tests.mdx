title: "Example Tech Tests"
---

Here are some example tech tests that you may come across when applying for roles.
Don't be too intimidated by them - many employers give around a week to come up with a solution. It is likely that you will need to revisit concepts, but also that you will need to utilise Google and StackOverflow to find additional answers where necessary.

* [Sky Bet 1](https://github.com/skybet/js-tech-test) - Would recommend using React. Anything above Task One is probably too much for a Junior, but if you do want to try Task Two and Task Three then please go for it.
* [Sky Bet 2](https://github.com/skybet/api-tech-test)
* [Sainsbury's](https://jsainsburyplc.github.io/front-end-test/)
* [Guardian Pairing Tests](https://github.com/guardian/pairing-tests)

There is a Google drive folder [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/126gt_sSwk1auwAQ8HAmfwaZAvLDphkk3) where the team upload tech tests that previous students have been given. If you do sit a tech test, send it over to us and we can add it for the benefit of others.
