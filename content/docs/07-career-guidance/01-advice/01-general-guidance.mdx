## You are ready for this

At first, applying for a technical position might seem daunting, but there really isn't that much to it and when you secure employment you'll likely look back on the process much more positively. We are fortunately in a circumstance where there aren't enough developers in the market with the correct skillset. You have intentionally been taught not just the necessary skills to land employment in the sector, but also industry-standard best practices that put you ahead of other applicants also applying for junior roles.

## You will get knocked down - do get back up again

As with any job hunting process, there is a strong likelihood you won't be successful on your first few interviews. You should use these as a learning experience. Ask for feedback, look back at what went well and what didn't go so great, pick yourself up and start over. If you applied for 1 job a day you could very easily be in a situation where you have multiple offers on the table 4 weeks later, so don't give up!

## Take a different approach

It's all too normal to just look on Indeed for available jobs or to talk to a recruiter. The truth in the matter is these recruitment methods cost employers a lot of money. Instead, look for employers you think you like the look of and do a bit of research on them. Once you know a bit about the company and think it's a place where you'd like to work then reach out:
- Visit the careers section on their website - is there an email address? If so send over a polite email with your CV attached and kindly ask if there are any junior vacancies. Ask them to keep your CV on file and to get in touch if anything comes up.
- Find the person on LinkedIn responsible for recruitment. Look for HR/Personnel/Resourcing/Talent/Internal Recruiter in the title. Drop them a message - it might be scary but for them it's very normal (to be honest it's the main reason they're on LinkedIn!).
- Attend tech events and meetups. These are a great opportunity to talk to employers in person. Look on [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/), [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/) and [North West Tech Community](https://technw.uk/calendar.html) for these.

## Take your time

- Whilst a CV should be a more general overview of yourself, if you do have your heart set on a specific role then do take time to tailor it.
- Don't copy and paste cover letters for different employers - they should be highly tailored to specific employers and job roles. 
- Doing well at the technical test is very important. Make regular commits, write tests and refactor where possible. If you have time, do a trial run first (in a private repository).

## Show enthusiasm

You would be very surprised how much time of day people in the recruitment process will give you if you show you have researched the company, like the work they do and ask questions about what it's like to work there.

## Personality counts

You aren't just being recruited on your skillset. Employers may want to see certain personality traits e.g. you can fit in and bond with the rest of the team/the company culture, that you're a confident and comfortable communicator and/or that you can assert yourself etc. Sell you as a person alongside your technical abilities.

## Get a new email address

This one is really only for people with emails such as ilovekittens@aol.com - your email should just be your name, ideally first and last. Any numbers at the end are absolutely fine.
