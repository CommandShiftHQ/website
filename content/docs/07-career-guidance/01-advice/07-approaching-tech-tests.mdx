title: "Approaching Tech Tests"
---

A tech test is an exercise that an employer will send you - usually after initial screening of your application or a first interview. Typically an employer will give you a time range in which to complete this which can generally be anywhere between 2 days to 2 weeks, and they may also mention a time limit in which they think you should complete the work in. It is quite common as well that what is asked of you by the employer is more than you are actually able to achieve in the time limit. In this scenario you should use your own discretion to decide whether you carry on or not (if you don't then you should mention this in your README and detail what approach you would have taken to finish the work).

## Checklist

- [ ] Do you have a README with a brief description of the task, your approach, installation instructions and next steps (if any?)? You should use a spellchecker. Bonus points for screenshot(s) and a link to a live demo (i.e. on Heroku or GitHub Pages).
- [ ] Have you made regular commits with meaningful commit messages?
- [ ] Is the code well abstracted into different files/folders?
- [ ] Is your code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)? Is there room for refactoring?
- [ ] Are different responsibilities separated into their own modules, as per the Single Responsibility Principle?
- [ ] Have you used a linter to check your syntax and indentation is consistent?

## What is the employer looking for?

The employer is looking to see how you approach the task they've given you i.e. did you write tests; what did you approach first; which technologies did you use; did you explain your approach? They're also going to be looking at your code to see that it's clean, readable, DRY and well abstracted.

It is expected that even if you can't finish a technical test, you've done enough to create something functional that the employer can use.

## Plan beforehand

Don't just dive in and start writing code. Read the requirements and any additional materials given twice-over. Decide on what technologies/libraries you will need to use. Draw out how interactions might work in terms of designs and database modelling.

### Ask the employer if you're unsure

If you've read through the requirements a couple of times and there's something you think you'll need further clarification on before you get going then ask the employer. This is normal.

### Write tests

If you can write tests then you should write tests - this is an easy way to impress.

### Commit meaningfully and often

You should commit for every significant change with a clear and concise message so the employer can see your approach.

### Do it yourself

You are applying for this job - not your friend, or the developer whose solution you copied from StackOverflow. You should expect to be questioned on your tech test, so make sure you're the one who wrote the code, and that you understand how it works. It's important to note also that you aren't supposed to ask others for help with this (including the Manchester Codes team) - it's a test of your ability. If you don't think it's achievable then you may need to take some time to re-visit materials and lectures, or it may be that the position you are applying for is out of reach.

### If you can't complete the task, explain in your README where you got up to and what you'd do next

Employers know you have other things to do. If you can't complete the whole task, then give them an idea of where you were going with it.
