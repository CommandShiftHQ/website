title: "02 - How to Get Support"
---

*Learning how to work through problems and push through setbacks is half the art of coding.*

**We will be pushing you to become as independent as possible**. As a junior, resilience is one of those qualities companies tend to look for. If/when you get stuck, we encourage you to think about the following steps:

**1. Try to find the solution for a problem by looking at the available resources.** One of the skills you’ll learn is how to do some effective googling, as well as breaking down and interpreting the official documentation that comes with some tools.

**2. Ask one of your peers.** Development is a highly sociable job, where you’re constantly discussing/reviewing your colleagues’ approaches, so get familiar with working in a team.

**3. Ask one of us.** As a developer, the better you are at explaining what the current problem is, the quicker you’ll get an answer. We’ll need you to give us proper context, as well as a description on what’s the expected behaviour, what’s actually happening - including any error messages - and all the approaches you’ve already tried.

**The initial 2 steps shouldn’t take longer than 10-15 minutes each.** If no solution has been found, move to step 3 and let’s solve it together.

:rotating_light: **Don't struggle on something for more than 30 mins before reaching out for support at this stage in your journey.** It can be easy to lose a few hours to a problem, but sometimes fresh eyes, or even just taking a break can be the key to solving it. :rotating_light:
