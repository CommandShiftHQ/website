#Finished the kata's?

Congratulations for getting to the end of your first JS track! Now all that is left is to get your code reviewed.   

In a professional environment, code reviews are common and necessary, so it will be good to get used to this as early on in your journey as possible. Plus, feedback on your code will help you grow as a developer and understand your code better.   

To submit your code for review, post a link to your github repo with a little request for review in your cohort channel and it will be added to the queue!

# Extra Materials 

## Free Code Camp

[JavaScript algorithms and data structures](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript) - up to "Word Blanks"

## CodeWars

We've been working all week on mini-kata exercises to try and re-inforce your coding knowledge and to get you to problem solve. Fortunately, there is a website where you can attempt these exercises online for further practice!
CodeWars Kata start easy at a difficulty of 8 KYU. As you get better, you can go down levels to 1 KYU (that does take a lot of time and commitment though).

## Task

1. Sign up for an account on [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com). You will have to do a quick kata to get to the signup form! **IMPORTANT:** Make sure you specify `Manchester Codes` for clan on the signup (if you do forget, then add it later in Account Settings).
2. Work through the exercises below. If you do finish then browse CodeWars for more exercises and get your points up. Some of these will be hard - you may need to use Google / StackOverflow / Mozilla Developer Network to piece together solutions.

## Exercises

### 8 KYU - Easier

* [Count the Monkeys!](https://www.codewars.com/kata/count-the-monkeys/javascript)
* [Beginner: Lost without a map](https://www.codewars.com/kata/beginner-lost-without-a-map/javascript)
* [Remove first and last character](https://www.codewars.com/kata/remove-first-and-last-character/javascript)
* [Number of people in the bus](https://www.codewars.com/kata/number-of-people-in-the-bus/javascript)

### 7 KYU - Harder

* [Monkey Tennis](https://www.codewars.com/kata/monkey-tennis-the-aftermath/javascript)
* [Count the number of JavaScript developers coming from Europe](https://www.codewars.com/kata/coding-meetup-number-1-higher-order-functions-series-count-the-number-of-javascript-developers-coming-from-europe/javascript)
* [Exes and Ohs](https://www.codewars.com/kata/exes-and-ohs/javascript)
* [Split in Parts](https://www.codewars.com/kata/split-in-parts/javascript)

## Bonus Points

* Create a repository called `codewars-kata`, and add, commit and push all of your solutions up to it (use the same folder/file structure as the `diy-kata` repository, splitting your solutions out into separate files).
* Look at the tests for each kata on CodeWars and see if you can translate them to Jest.
