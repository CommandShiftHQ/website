title: "Objects"

The most powerful data structure in JavaScript is an object. These can be used to represent **entities**.

Let's look at why we might use objects. 

Imagine you are storing data about yourself within your code:

* Your name can be represented in JavaScript by a string.
* Whether you like spicy food can be represented by a boolean.
* Your age can be represented by a number.
* Your favourite books can be represented by an array.

```js
const michaelsName = 'Michael';
const michaelsAge = 27;
const doesMichaelLikeSpicyFood = true;
const michaelsFavouriteBooks = ['The old man and the sea', 'You dont know JS'];
```

But how do you group all of these facts about a person together? How do you represent a person?

The answer is to use **objects** - an object is a set of **key-value pairs** that is used to represent...anything!

```js
const michael = {
  name: 'Michael',
  age: 27,
  likesSpicyFood: true,
  favouriteBooks: ['The old man and the sea', 'You dont know JS'],
};
```

That's instantly a much clearer representation of a person than the 4 seperate values we created above:

* The `michael` object has 4 **keys** - `name`, `age`, `likesSpicyFood`, `favouriteBooks`.
* The **values** of those keys are `'Michael'`, `27`, `true`, and `['The old man and the sea', 'You dont know JS']` respectively.

You can add as many keys as you like, and they can have any values you like.

To access the value of a key, you can use **dot notation**:

```js
michael.name; // 'Michael'
michael.age; // 27
michael.likesSpicyFood; // true
michael.favouriteBooks; // ['The old man and the sea', 'You dont know JS']
```

It's also possible to use square bracket notation

It's worth repeating that objects are the most powerful data structure available in JavaScript. They allow us to model the real world in a simple and flexible way, and are the foundation of **Object Oriented Programming**, which we will be focussing on in the next few weeks.

As the W3Schools article linked to at the bottom says:

```
In JavaScript, objects are king. If you understand objects, you understand JavaScript.
```

There are 10 object-related challenges for you to complete with your pair. Most of these build on the concepts from the provious challenges.

To run the tests for this challenge, run `npm test -- objects`

In the same manner as before, try to fix all of the failing tests.

- Run the tests
- Read the error message
- Write some code to fix that message
- Repeat

And again, commit to git regularly, and use the links provided and google to help you if you get stuck!
