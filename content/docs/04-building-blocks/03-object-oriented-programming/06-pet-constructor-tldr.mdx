title: "Pet Constructor - ;TLDR"
---

In JavaScript, we can use **constructor functions** to create objects of the same type. These objects can be used to model things in the real world.

To create a new **instance** of an object, we use the `new` keyword.

The first feature of our virtual pet is that it should have a name.

In this challenge, we are going to create a `Pet` constructor function that will allow us to create our new pet.

## Learning objectives

- feature testing in the Node REPL

- writing unit tests to describe expected behaviour of a function

- debugging using a stack trace

- exporting things from files using `module.exports`

- requiring exported values using `require`

- writing a constructor function

##  To complete this challenge, you will need to:

- open the Node REPL

- create a new variable `pet` equal to `new Pet('Fido');`

- discuss the resulting error with your cohort mates

  - what is the type of error?

  - research what this error type means.

  - can you suggest a way of solving the problem?

- translate this error into a unit test - what do you expect to happen when you call `new Pet('Fido')`?

- create a `Pet` constructor function and export it from the file

- require the `Pet` function into your unit test and make the test pass

Once you are done, commit your work, and push to GitHub:
