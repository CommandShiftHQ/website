title: "Naming Pets - ;TLDR"
---

So far, our `Pet` constructor just gives us an empty object. It's a start, but it's only halfway to our first feature - a pet with a name.

In this challenge, we are going to adapt the `Pet` function so that our pets can have names.

How would we want this to look? So far we can create a new instance of `Pet` by typing `const pet = new Pet('Fido');` in the Node REPL.

How would you adapt that code to be able to give the pet a name? What would you expect the outcome of that action to be?

Try the following in the Node REPL:

```js
const pet = new Pet('Fido');

pet.name;
```

What value do you get back?

## Learning objectives

- setting properties of objects using constructors

- `this`

##  To complete this challenge, you will need to:

- discuss this outcome with your cohort mates:

  - what would you want the outcome to be?

  - how does this differ from what you are seeing?

  - can you suggest a way of solving the problem?

- translate this error into a new unit test - what do you expect to happen when you call `new Pet('fido');`?

- update your `Pet` constructor function to make the test pass

Once you are done, commit your work, and push to GitHub
