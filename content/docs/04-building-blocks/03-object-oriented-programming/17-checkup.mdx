title: "Checkup"
---

We can now feed and walk our pets, but how do we know when we need to?

Your challenge in this step is to give the `Pet` function a `checkUp` method that lets you know how the pet is feeling.

- if the pet's fitness is 3 or less, it should return `'I need a walk'`.

- if the pet's hunger is 5 or more, it should return `'I am hungry'`.

- if both of the above are true, it should return `'I am hungry AND I need a walk'`

- if neither of the above are true, it should return `'I feel great!'`

##  To complete this challenge, you will need to:

- test the expected behaviour in the Node CLI

- write unit tests to to cover the expected behaviour

- implement the code to make the tests pass

- refactor your code

Once you are done, commit your work, push to GitHub. :twisted_rightwards_arrows:
