title: "Getting older - ;TLDR"

Sadly, there comes a time when your new pet has to grow up.

Your challenge in this step is to test-drive the `growUp` feature of the `Pet` function.

This can be broken down into two steps:

- The `Pet` should have an initial age of `0`

- The `growUp` method should increase the `age` property by `1`

## Learning objectives

- define a method as a function belonging to an object

- understand what is meant by an objects **prototype**

- understand why we add methods to the prototype

- understand why we don't usually add properties to the prototype

##  To complete this challenge, you will need to:

- test the expected behaviour in the Node CLI

- write unit tests to to cover the expected behaviour

- implement the code to make the tests pass

Once you are done, commit your work and push to GitHub
