title: "Keeping Fed - ;TLDR"
---

We also want to counteract our pets getting hungry.

Your challenge in this step is to give the `Pet` function a `feed` method that decreases it's hunger level.

- calling `feed` should decrease the Pet's hunger level by `3`.

- A pet's hunger level should never go below `0`.

##  To complete this challenge, you will need to:

- test the expected behaviour in the Node CLI

- write unit tests to to cover the expected behaviour

- implement the code to make the tests pass

- refactor your code

Once you are done, commit your work and push to GitHub.
