title: "Guard Clauses - ;TLDR"
---

Now that we have brought mortality to our virtual pets, we need to let them rest in peace.

Your challenge in this step is to add some **guard clauses** to the `walk`, `growUp` and `feed` functions to prevent them from being used if the pet is not alive. We also need to an a new return value to the `checkUp` function.

- if the pet is not alive, the `checkUp` function should return `'Your pet is no longer alive :('`

- if the pet is not alive, the `walk`, `growUp` and `feed` functions should each throw an exception `'Your pet is no longer alive :('`.

- it the pet is alive, they should behave as before.

## Learning objectives

- Adding guard clauses to prevent misuse of a function

- Throwing exceptions

- Errors

- Testing errors

##  To complete this challenge, you will need to:

- test the expected behaviour in the Node CLI

- write unit tests to to cover the expected behaviour

- add guard clauses to the Pet's methods

Once you are done, commit your work, push to GitHub, and then you're done! Congrats!
