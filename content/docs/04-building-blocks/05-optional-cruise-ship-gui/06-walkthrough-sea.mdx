# Sea - Walkthrough

## Steps

- Create a new constructor function called `Controller` in `src/controller.js`.
- Create a new prototype method for `Controller` called `initialiseSea`, and call it from within the constructor.
- Import the `controller.js` file into your html using a `script` tag at the end of the `body`.
- Add another `script` tag underneathm but this time use inline JavaScript to create a new instance of `Controller`.
- Inside your `initialiseSea` method, use `setInterval` to run a callback function every `1000` milliseconds. Inside the callback function use `document.querySelector` to find the `#viewport` element and change the background image so it alternates between `water0.png` and `water1.png`. You'll probably want to keep some sort of "counter" variable outside of your `setInterval` to determine which background image to use.

## Create a new constructor called `Controller`.

Inside your `src/` folder, add a new file called `controller.js` and create a constructor:

```js
function Controller () {}
```

## Create a new prototype method for `Controller` called `initialiseSea`, and call it from within the constructor.

```js
function Controller() {
  this.initialiseSea();
}

Controller.prototype.initialiseSea = function initialiseSea() {

};
```

Remember, `this` refers to the current instance of an object. In this case, `this.initialiseSea()` won't exist on the object itself, but it will exist on it's prototype (which JavaScript falls back to) so we're okay to call it this way.

## Add a `script` tag to the end of your `index.html` body which includes the `Controller.js` file.

```html
<body>
  ...
  <script src="src/controller.js"></script>
</body>
```

## Add another `script` tag underneath but this time enter JS between the tags to create a new instance of `Controller`.

```html
<body>
  ...
  <script src="src/controller.js"></script>
  <script>
    const controller = new Controller();
  </script>
</body>
```

The order of the `script` tags is important here, as the JavaScript gets loaded in the order specified.

What do you think would happen if we did swap the order of these `script` tags? Why?

Try it out and see what happens! Remember, you can look in your browser console to help you debug.

## Inside your `initialiseSea` method, use `window.setInterval` to run a callback function every `1000` milliseconds.

```js
Controller.prototype.initialiseSea = function initialiseSea() {
  window.setInterval(() => {}, 1000);
};
```

Here, `window` is a globally accessible object provided by the browser. It provides some built in functionality for us when we write JavaScript to run in the browser.

Interestingly, properties on the `window` object are normally available as global variables themselves - for example the `console` object (of `console.log` fame) is actually `window.console`...

`setInterval` is a method which allows us to run a task at regular intervals. It's like a loop that repeats forever. It's going to be handy for animating the sea - the animation will continue indefinitely.

The above code runs the empty function every 1 second (1000 milliseconds). Try putting a `console.log` into the function. Reload the page and check your browser console - you should see the message be printed out every second.

## Inside the callback function use `document.querySelector` to find the `#viewport` element and change the background image so it alternates between `water0.png` and `water1.png`.

Inside the `initialiseSea` method, we'll firstly create an array of the background images we want to alternate between:

```js
Controller.prototype.initialiseSea = function initialiseSea() {
  const backgrounds = [
    './images/water0.png',
    './images/water1.png',
  ];
  window.setInterval(() => {}, 1000);
};
```

Then we'll create a "counter" variable to help us keep track of which background is currently in use:

```js
Controller.prototype.initialiseSea = function initialiseSea() {
  const backgrounds = [
    './images/water0.png',
    './images/water1.png',
  ];
  let backgroundIndex = 0;
  window.setInterval(() => {}, 1000);
};
```

Now let's bulk the `setInterval` callback function out so it changes our background image:

```js
window.setInterval(() => {
  document.querySelector('#viewport').style.backgroundImage = `url('${backgrounds[backgroundIndex % backgrounds.length]}')`;
  backgroundIndex += 1;
}, 1000);
```

[Template literals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals) have been used here to interpolate a background image from the `backgrounds` array. Please read about them - they are amazing.

We use `document.querySelector('#viewport')` here which finds the `<div id="viewport"></div>` HTML element and returns it as a **DOM object**.

Remember, DOM Objects are JavaScript objects that represent HTML elements.

:books: [DOM Element API Reference at MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element)

You'll also notice we've used the global variable `document` - this is another thing that comes from the browser, and it represents the the html document as a whole.

Don't worry about `document` so much for now, just be aware what it is and what it represents.

:books: [Document API Reference at MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document)

Any attributes that the HTML element can have will exist as keys/property names on the DOM object, so for example `document.querySelector('#viewport')` will return a DOM object that might look like:

```js
{
  id: 'viewport',
}
```

DOM elements also have a `style` property which represents the inline styles applied to the html element. This is also an object.

So `document.querySelector('#viewport').style.backgroundImage = 'url(...)'` sets the `backgroundImage` attribute on the `style` object, so we end up with something like this:

```js
{
  style: {
    backgroundImage: 'url(...)'
  }
}
```

Which in turn (behind the scenes) is doing this to the HTML element:

```html
<div id="viewport" style="background-image: url(...)">
</div>
```

If you look in your browser, you will see that this is exactly what is happening:

After the DOM manipulation, we just increase the counter by one.

We use the module `%` operator to loop the index back to the start of the images array. If you don't remember this, look back to your `javascript-basics` work from the beginning of the course.

## Linting
You may get some linting error in this step saying that `window` or `document` are not defined. This is because these are global variables that are provided by the browser, and ESLint doesn't know about them.
To fix this, add the following to you `.eslintrc` file:
```json
{
    "extends": "mcr-codes",
    "env": {
        "browser": true
    }
}
```
This extra configuration tells ESLint that our code is going to run in a browser environment, so it should not error when it encounters global variables such as `document` and `window`.
