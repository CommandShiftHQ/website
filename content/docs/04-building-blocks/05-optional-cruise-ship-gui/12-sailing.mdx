# Sailing

We have a ship and some ports - lets sail away!!!

## Challenge

Create a new "Set Sail" button which, when clicked, will move the ship gradually over to the next port.

## To complete this challenge, you will need to:

- Add a button to `index.html` with an id of `#sailbutton`.
- Style and position the button using CSS.
- Modify the `Controller` constructor so it takes a parameter of `ship`. Set `this.ship` to `ship` and modify any other references to `ship` in `Controller` to come from `this.ship`, not method parameters.
- Modify your constructor call in `index.html` so it also takes a ship.
- Add a `click` event listener to the button inside the `Controller` constructor and set the callback function to an arrow function that calls `this.setSail`.
- Add a `setSail` method to the `Controller.prototype`. 
- Use the index of the next port in the ship's itinerary to find the corresponding DOM element
- Set the ship's left position to the next port's `offsetLeft` - do so gradually using `setInterval`, adding 1px every n (you choose) milliseconds, so the boat moves along gradually. Be sure to use `clearInterval` when the ship reaches the port, and be sure to call `ship.dock` so our instance of `Ship` is updated.
- Alert the user that they're at the end of their cruise if they attempt to go further than the itinerary.
