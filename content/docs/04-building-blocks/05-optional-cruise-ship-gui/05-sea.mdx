# Sea

We're going to use JavaScript to change the background of our viewport every second so our water moves.

To do this we are going to create a `Controller` constructor/prototype, which is responsible for interacting with and updating the DOM based on the state of our application.

## Challenge

Use a combination of `setInterval` with a duration of `1000` (1000 milliseconds = 1 second) and `document.querySelector` to manipulate the viewport background. 

You may need the walkthrough for this step as there are many concepts to cover.

## To complete this challenge, you will need to:

- Create a new constructor function called `Controller` in `src/controller.js`.
- Create a new prototype method for `Controller` called `initialiseSea`, and call it from within the constructor.
- Import the `controller.js` file into your html using a `script` tag at the end of the `body`.
- Add another `script` tag underneathm but this time use inline JavaScript to create a new instance of `Controller`.
- Inside your `initialiseSea` method, use `setInterval` to run a callback function every `1000` milliseconds. Inside the callback function use `document.querySelector` to find the `#viewport` element and change the background image so it alternates between `water0.png` and `water1.png`. You'll probably want to keep some sort of "counter" variable outside of your `setInterval` to determine which background image to use.
