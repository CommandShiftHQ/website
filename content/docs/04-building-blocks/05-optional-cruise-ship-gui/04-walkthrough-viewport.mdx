# Viewport - Walkthrough

## Steps

- Style your `html` and `body` elements so they have a height of `100%`.
- Style your `body` so its background is black.
- Set the `body` as a flex container and ensure any children are center aligned on both the horizontal and vertical axis.
- Create a `main` tag inside your body with an id attribute of `viewport`.
- Style the `main` element (using an ID CSS selector) so it has the following properties:
    - a width of `640px`
    - a height of `256px`
    - a `position` of `relative`
    - an `overflow-x` of `auto`
    - a `background-image` which should be the `water0.png` image.

## Style your `html` and `body` elements so they have a height of `100%`.

In `css/style.css`:

```css
html, body {
  height: 100%;
}
```

This will ensure our viewport is able to be centered vertically inside the browser window, as by default `html` and `body` are 100% wide but wrap their height to their contents. By specififying a height of 100%, these elements will now be as tall as the browser window.

## Style your `body` so its background is black. Set it as a flex container and ensure any children are center aligned on both the horizontal and vertical axis.

In `css/style.css`:

```css
body {
  background-color: #000;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}
```

`justify-content` aligns the child elements horizontally, `align-items` vertically.

## Create a `div` tag inside your body with an id attribute. Use `viewport` as the id.

In between the opening and closing `body` tags in `index.html`:

```html
<div id="viewport">
</div>
```

## Style the `div` (using an ID CSS selector) so it has a width of `640px`, a height of `256px`, a `position` of `relative`, an `overflow-x` of `auto`, and finally a background image which should be the `water0.png` image.

In `css/style.css`:

```css
#viewport {
  width: 640px;
  height: 256px;
  position: relative;
  overflow-x: auto;
  background-image: url('../images/water0.png');
}
```

We specify `position: relative;` here because we want any items inside of the viewport to base their X/Y coordinates off of the top left of the viewport, not the browser window.

We specify `overflow-x: auto;` because we want the viewport to scroll horizontally if any of it's children exceed the width.
