# Viewport

We're going to have a small letterbox-style viewport that will contain our sea/ports/ship:

![Viewport](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/avocado-on-toast.appspot.com/o/cruise-ships-gui%2Fviewport.png?alt=media&token=82a51ead-778a-472b-bf66-458ef0772fc4)

## Challenge

Use HTML and CSS (including flexbox) to create the above.

## To complete this challenge, you will need to:

- Style your `html` and `body` elements so they have a height of `100%`.
- Style your `body` so its background is black.
- Set the `body` as a flex container and ensure any children are center aligned on both the horizontal and vertical axis.
- Create a `div` tag inside your body with an id attribute of `viewport`.
- Style the `viewport` element (using an ID CSS selector) so it has the following properties:
    - a width of `640px`
    - a height of `256px`
    - a `position` of `relative`
    - an `overflow-x` of `auto`
    - a `background-image` which should be the `water0.png` image.

Make sure you understand what all of these style rules do before you move on!
