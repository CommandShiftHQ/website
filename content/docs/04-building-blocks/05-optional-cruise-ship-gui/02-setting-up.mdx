# Setting up your project

We're going to add a layer on top of our week 5/6 Cruise Ships project. If you haven't completed this up to step 6 then there is an example [here](https://github.com/MCRcodes/cruise-ships) which you can clone down and use.

- Create a new repository on GitHub called `cruise-ships-gui` without a README. 

- `cd` into your `cruise-ships` project folder from weeks 5-6 and open up VS Code. If you haven't completed the challenge, [clone our example repository](https://github.com/MCRcodes/cruise-ships)
- Add a new remote to link your new Github repo to your prohject.
- Create an `index.html` file in the project root, and populate the DOCTYPE (hint: type `!` followed by `Tab` in the file, and VS Code will do this for you):

![DOCTYPE](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/avocado-on-toast.appspot.com/o/cruise-ships-gui%2Fvscode-doctype.gif?alt=media&token=44a9069d-ca60-45d2-a616-eb6bd1a019be)

- Create a `css` directory in your project root.
- Download normalize.css from [here](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) (right click and save into your `css/` folder).
- Create a new `style.css` file inside your `css/` directory.
- Create an `images` directory inside your project root.
- Download the image files for this week from [here](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/avocado-on-toast.appspot.com/o/cruise-ships-gui%2Fimages.zip?alt=media&token=d73afc8f-2e70-4c0e-9781-3423ab2af8b1) and extract them into your `images/` folder.
- Use the [`link`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/link) tag to import these CSS files into your `index.html` file.
 
N.B. `normalize.css` is a set of css rules which override or strip away some of the default stylings applied by the browser.
The reason for this is that different browsers apply different default stylings to some elements, which can cause your page to get rendered differenly in different browsers.
Normalize aims to solve this problem, so it's normally work including it in your projects that use css.

If you have done everything correctly, your file tree should look like this:

![File Tree](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/avocado-on-toast.appspot.com/o/cruise-ships-gui%2Ffile_tree.png?alt=media&token=5e1ce877-221b-4788-84a4-ec41541d49f4)

And your `index.html` file should look like this:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge">

  <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/normalize.css">
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css">

<body>

</body>
