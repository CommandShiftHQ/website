# Ship

## Steps

- Create a new instance of `Ship` inside the inline JS in `index.html`, passing in your itinerary.
- Create a new `div` with the id `ship` inside the `#viewport` div.
- In `style.css` add a new `#ship` ruleset. You want to use the `ship.png` background image, and specify a width and height that matches that image's dimensions. You should also specify a `position` of `absolute` as later on we will want to control our element's X/Y co-ordinates within the viewport.
- Add a `renderShip` method to your `Controller.prototype`, which has a single parameter of `ship`.
- Back in `index.html`, call `controller.renderShip` and pass in your `ship` from before.
- In the `renderShip` method, find the index of the ship's `currentPort` inside of its `itinerary`. Use `document.querySelector` with an attribute selector to find a `.port` element that has a `portIndex` data attribute which corresponds to this index.
- Prior to appending to the DOM, set the `top` and `left` CSS properties of your ship element to the [offsetTop](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/offsetTop) and [offsetLeft](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/offsetLeft) values for the port element.
- Add or subtract from your `offsetLeft` and/or `offsetTop` values to position your ship so it's centered directly underneath the port.

## Create a new instance of `Ship` inside the inline JS in `index.html`, passing in your itinerary.

```html
<script>
  ...
  const itinerary = new Itinerary([
    new Port('New York City'), 
    new Port('Grand Turk'),
    new Port('San Juan'),
    new Port('Amber Cove')
  ]);
  const ship = new Ship(itinerary);
  ...
</script>
```

## Create a new `div` with the id `ship` inside the `#viewport` div.

```html
<div id="viewport">
  <div id="ports">
  </div>
  <div id="ship"></div>
</div>
```

We will only have one ship so we use an id attribute, as ID selectors are unique.

## In `style.css` add a new `#ship` ruleset. You want to use the `ship.png` background image, and specify a width and height that matches that image's dimensions. You should also specify a `position` of `absolute` as later on we will want to control our element's X/Y co-ordinates within the viewport.

```css
#ship {
  width: 128px;
  height: 64px;
  background-image: url('../images/ship.png');
  position: absolute;
}
```

`position: absolute` will position the element _relative_ to the nearest outer element with a `position: relative` rule (or the `body` if one doesn't exist). In this case, we have `position: relative` set on the `#viewport` element so our ship element positions itself relative to this.

## Add a `renderShip` method to your `Controller.prototype`, which has a single parameter of `ship`.

```js
Controller.prototype = {
  ...
  renderShip(ship) {},
};
```

The ship parameter will accept an argument of a `Ship` object.

## Back in `index.html`, call `controller.renderShip` and pass in your `ship` from before.

```js
controller.renderShip(ship);
```

## In the `renderShip` method, find the index of the ship's `currentPort` inside of its `itinerary.ports`. Use `document.querySelector` with an attribute selector to find a `.port` element that has a `portIndex` data attribute which corresponds to this index.

```js
const shipPortIndex = ship.itinerary.ports.indexOf(ship.currentPort);
const portElement = document.querySelector(`[data-port-index='${shipPortIndex}']`);
```

This is where we start to go down through objects again. Remember that a Ship can have an Itinerary which can have Ports and that we can use dot notation in JavaScript to go down through this so `ship.itinerary` is the `Itinerary` object we passed in when we created our `ship`. `ship.itinerary.ports` is the array of `Port`s we passed in when we created our `itinerary`. `ship.currentPort` will be inside of `ship.itinerary.ports` as a `Ship` object uses its `itinerary.ports` array to determine its `currentPort`, so we know that `shipPortIndex` will always be what we want it to be.

Next we use a data attribute selector inside of `document.querySelector` to find our port element. Read more about data attribute selectors [here](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/selectors/a/attribute/). We use template literals again to interpolate the port index. Remember that the `data-port-index` attributes our port DOM elements all correspond to the same array of ports we query in our `indexOf` here, so again there will always be a corresponding value.

## Prior to appending to the DOM, set the `top` and `left` CSS properties of your ship element to the [offsetTop](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/offsetTop) and [offsetLeft](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/offsetLeft) values for the port element.

```js
const shipElement = document.querySelector('#ship');
shipElement.style.top = `${portElement.offsetTop}px`;
shipElement.style.left = `${portElement.offsetLeft}px`;
```

`offsetTop` and `offsetLeft` give us the X/Y co-ordinates of an object of how far it is from it's parent element's top and left co-ordinates. In this case, the parent of `portElement` is `#ports` so we position our ship in the same place as the DOM element representing its `currentPort`.

- [offsetParent](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/offsetParent)
- [offsetTop](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/offsetTop)
- [offsetLeft](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/offsetLeft)

## Add or subtract from your `offsetLeft` and/or `offsetTop` values to position your ship so it's centered directly underneath the port.

The above will leave your ship in a rather awkward position sat on top of a port. Add and subtract inside of your template literals to adjust the position to your liking:

```js
shipElement.style.top = `${portElement.offsetTop + 32}px`;
shipElement.style.left = `${portElement.offsetLeft - 32}px`;
```
