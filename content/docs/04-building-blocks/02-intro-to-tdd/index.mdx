title: "Test Driven Development"
---

This week we're looking at writing our own JavaScript tests, before proceeding to write the code that makes them pass.

## Learning objectives

To be able to answer "yes" to the following questions:

- Can you write a test that describes the expected behaviour of a unit?

- Can you use that test as a reference to write some code for the unit?

- When you've passed the test, can you find ways to refactor the code?

## Concepts

- Test-Driven Development

- Unit Testing

- Jest

- Refactoring

- DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself

## Challenge

This week's challenge uses the [DIY Kata](https://github.com/MCRcodes/diy-kata-3) repository on GitHub. 

* [ ] Fork the [repository](https://github.com/MCRcodes/diy-kata-3) to your own GitHub profile.

* [ ] Clone down your fork.

* [ ] Change directory into your cloned folder and run `npm install`.
