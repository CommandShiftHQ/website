title: "Employee Role"
---

## Expected Behaviour

Your function should have two parameters: `employeeName` (string) and `employees` (array).

Given an array of `employees`, and an `employeeName`, you should find and return that person's `role` in the company.

E.g.

If we have the following employees:

```js

const employees = [{

  name: 'Satti',

  role: 'Developer'

}, {

  name: 'Jenny',

  role: 'Sales Associate'

}, {

  name: 'Javid',

  role: 'Human Recommended Reading Assistant'

}]

```

When calling the `getEmployerRole` function like so:

```js

getEmployerRole('Javid', employees);

```

We would expect a return value of:

```js

'Human Recommended Reading Assistant'

```

## Assertion

- returns the employee's role in the company

## Run tests

```bash

npm run test -- getEmployerRole

```
