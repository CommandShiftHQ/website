title: "Isolating with stubs ;TLDR"
---

[:zap: Stubs](https://hackmd.io/s/SyR-1Kh8V)

## Challenge

Incorporate stubs into your test suites in places where they could be used instead of a real object. 

Hint: the only test suite that isn't isolated currently is `Ship.test.js`, as it uses the `Itinerary` object.

## To complete this challenge, you will need to:

- Look for any places in the test suite where objects are passed into methods where it would be straightforward to stub those objects. 
- Replace them with stubs.
- Run your tests again to ensure they still pass (might be better to run tests after every change).
