title: "Ship Object - Walkthrough"
---

## Steps

- Discuss with your classmates what the domain model would look like for the above user story. Would recommend a pen and paper for this step.
- Create a new test file, which should `describe` your constructor.
- Create a new test spec (`it`) for ensuring an instance of your object can be created.
- Write the code that makes this test pass.
- Create another test spec for each property and/or method you identify.
- Write the code that makes this test pass.
- Add, commit with a meaningful message, and push to GitHub.

## Domain Model

From the user story:

```
As a cruise ship captain,
So I can get passengers aboard a ship,
I want a ship to have a starting port.
```

The domain model for this user story might look like this:

| Object | Methods    | Properties   |
|--------|------------|--------------|
| Ship   |            | startingPort |

## `describe` Ship

We have a `Ship` object so we'll describe a `Ship` constructor.

Create a `__tests__` folder in your project root, and inside create a new file `Ship.test.js`.

First, we'll import in our constructor file. It doesn't exist yet, but we're developing using a test-driven approach, so that's okay:

![Module import](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/avocado-on-toast.appspot.com/o/cruise-ships%2Fmodule_import.png?alt=media&token=3b888b00-401d-4ec2-a42f-e39dc12d0867)

:exclamation: The `/* globals describe it expect */` just tells VS Code and the linter that these variables don't exist in the scope (because the `jest` test runner brings them into scope), so don't show linter errors for them.

Then below, we'll `describe` our constructor:

![describe](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/avocado-on-toast.appspot.com/o/cruise-ships%2Fdescribe.png?alt=media&token=1cf854a6-7f08-445a-9c58-8470a9b06d59)

Save the file, and in your Terminal run `npm run test`. You should fail with the following:

![Module not found](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/avocado-on-toast.appspot.com/o/cruise-ships%2Fmodule_not_found.png?alt=media&token=0ed0ba53-ddfb-4332-a0d3-9b057096e844)

The error here is: `Cannot find module '../src/Ship.js' from 'Ship.test.js'`. We can solve this by creating the `Ship.js` file in a new folder in the project root: `src/`. Run your tests again. You should now fail with:

![No tests](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/avocado-on-toast.appspot.com/o/cruise-ships%2Fno_tests.png?alt=media&token=bffc6898-1754-4dd5-aace-d31f8482948f)

## Test an instance of Ship can be created

To fix this error, we can proceed to write our first test:

![it instantiates](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/avocado-on-toast.appspot.com/o/cruise-ships%2Fit_instantiates.png?alt=media&token=8d0b10ab-48ea-472f-934c-0d16c6c12586)

Run your tests:

![Ship is not a constructor](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/avocado-on-toast.appspot.com/o/cruise-ships%2Fnot_a_constructor.png?alt=media&token=2e8497e4-b5bd-4140-b6a2-73adac4ac754)

## Write the code to make this pass

:exclamation: You should be able to do this without the walkthrough. Once you've passed the test, then proceed.

## `it` has a `startingPort`

We identified a property of `startingPort` during the domain modelling, so write a test to check a `Ship` has this property:

![Has startingPort](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/avocado-on-toast.appspot.com/o/cruise-ships%2Fhas_port.png?alt=media&token=4afbd9e0-f64d-4a40-b656-312479758afc)

Run your tests. They should fail with:

```bash
  ● Ship › has a starting port
    expect(received).toBe(expected) // Object.is equality
    Expected: "Dover"
    Received: undefined
    Difference:
      Comparing two different types of values. Expected string but received undefined.
      10 |     const ship = new Ship('Dover');
      11 |
    > 12 |     expect(ship.startingPort).toBe('Dover');
         |                               ^
      13 |   });
      14 | });
      15 |
      at Object.it (__tests__/Ship.test.js:12:31)
```

## Write the code to make this pass

:exclamation: You should be able to do this without the walkthrough. Once you've passed the test, then proceed.

## Add, commit with a meaningful message, and push to GitHub.

```bash
git add __tests__/Ship.test.js
git add src/Ship.js
git commit -m "Tests for Ship and Ship constructor"
git push origin main 
```
