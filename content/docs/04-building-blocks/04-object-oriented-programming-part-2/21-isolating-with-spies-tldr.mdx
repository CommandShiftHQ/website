title: "Isolating with spies ;TLDR"
---

Read [:zap: Stubs](https://hackmd.io/s/SyR-1Kh8V) first.

A spy or a mock is a function that records the interactions our application has with it. In Jest, a mock function becomes a spy when we use a `toHaveBeenCalled` or `toHaveBeenCalledWith` matcher.

`.toHaveBeenCalled()` - expect a mock function to have been called as part of the test.

`.toHaveBeenCalledWith(arg1, arg2)` - expect a mock function to have been called with one or more arguments as part of the test.

Let's look at an example:

```js
function VendingMachine () {
  this.total = 0;
}

VendingMachine.prototype.purchaseSnack = function purchaseSnack (snack) {
  this.total += snack.price;

  snack.addSale()
}

function Snack (name, price) {
  this.name = name
  this.price = price
  this.sales = 0
}

Snack.prototype.addSale = function addSale () {
  this.sales += 1
}

test('snack can be purchased', () => {
  const vendingMachine = new VendingMachine();
  const snack = { name: 'Milkybar', price: 0.60, addSale: jest.fn() }; // stub with spy method

  vendingMachine.purchaseSnack(snack);

  expect(snack.addSale).toHaveBeenCalled();
})
```

In the above example, assume that our `test` is part of the test suite for `VendingMachine`. We don't want to pass a real `Snack` object into our `VendingMachine`'s `purchaseSnack` method, as this wouldn't be an isolated test, so instead we stub `snack`, ensuring the interface matches that of our `Snack` prototype/constructor. When our stub does get passed into `purchaseSnack`, the `addSale` method gets called, which in this case is our spy. The assertion below `expect(snack.addSale).toBeCalled()` therefore passes, as the `addSale` method was called.

## Challenge

We have a problem in our `Ship` test suite currently in that 3 tests directly test the `Port` object:

```
Ship
  can set sail
  gets added to port on instantiation
  can dock at a different port
```

Refactor these tests so that they incorporate spies.

## To complete this challenge, you will need to:

Note many of the changes below will happen in the `beforeEach` function callback. You will need to use the matcher `toHaveBeenCalledWith`.

- In `can set sail` you will need to remove the assertion on `port.ships` and instead assert that `ship.setSail` calls `port.removeShip` (where `port` is a stub, and `removeShip` is a method on that stub).
- In `gets added to port on instantiation` you will need to remove the assertion on `port.ships` and instead assert that `port.addShip` has been called (again, `addShip` will be a spy on a `port` stub).
- In `can dock at a different port` you will need to remove the assertion on `calais.ships` and instead assert that `calais.addShip` has been called with `ship` (again, `addShip` will be a spy on a `port` stub).
