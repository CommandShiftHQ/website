title: "Port Object ;TLDR"
---

```
As a cruise ship captain,
So I can get passengers to a new destination,
I want a ship to be able to dock at a different port.
```

## Challenge

In this user story, a `ship` doesn't possess a `port` - it docks at one. Therefore, your domain model likely needs a new `Port` object. 

Since our application now has more than one port, we need a way to differentiate between them, so lets assume a `Port` has a `name`.

There is also another doing word for a `Ship`: `dock`.

## To complete this challenge, you will need to:

- Discuss with your classmates how the domain model might be added to in this scenario.
- Create a new test file, which should `describe` a new `Port` object.
- Create a new test spec to check the new `Port` object can be instantiated. 
- Write the code that makes this test pass.
- Create a new test spec to check the new `Port` object has a `name` property. 
- Write the code that makes this test pass.
- Refactor the `Ship` test suite so a `Ship` takes a `Port` object instead of a string and check tests still pass.
- Create a new test spec inside `Ship.test.js` to test a `dock` method.
- Write the code that makes this test pass.
- Add, commit with a meaningful message, and push to GitHub.
