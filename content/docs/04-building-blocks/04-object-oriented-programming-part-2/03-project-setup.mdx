title: "Project Setup"
---

Before we crack on with the code, we'll initialise Git to track our project using version control, we'll create a package.json so we can use Jest, and we'll install a linter to keep the code clean as we go along.


- Create a `cruise-ships` repository on GitHub without a README.

- Create a `cruise-ships` directory in the command line.

- `cd` into `cruise-ships` and initialise a Git repo.

- Initialise an npm project, setting `jest` as the test command.

- Install the `jest` package as a developer dependency.

- Create a `.gitignore` file in the project root and add `node_modules/` to it.

- Add all of your files to the staging area.

- Commit your changes with a clear message.

- Add a new `origin` remote that points to your GitHub repository: `git remote add origin <https_link_to_your_repo>`.

- Push the project to your newly created GitHub repository.
