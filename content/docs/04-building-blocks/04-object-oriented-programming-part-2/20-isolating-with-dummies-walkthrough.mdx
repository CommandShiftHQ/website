title: "Isolating with dummies - Walkthrough"
---

## Steps

- Look for any places in the test suite where objects are passed into methods where those methods don't use the object. 
- Replace them with dummies.
- Run your tests again to ensure they still pass (might be better to run tests after every change).

## Identifying a place in the test suite where a dummy could be used

There are three tests where we could utilise dummies:

```
Port
  can add a ship
  can remove a ship

Itinerary
  can have ports
```

Have a look at these tests and see if you can see why and where test dummies could be incorporated. 

## Replace them with dummies.

We'll do one together - `can add a ship`:

Change:

```js
const ship = {};
```

To:

```js
const ship = jest.fn();
```

You should be able to add dummies to the other two tests without the walkthrough.

## Run your tests again to ensure they still pass

(They should).

## Add, commit with a meaningful message, and push to GitHub.
