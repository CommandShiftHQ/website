title: "Set Sail - Walkthrough"
---

## Steps

- Discuss with your classmates how the domain model for Ship might be added to with the above user story.
- Create a new test spec for the user story.
- Write the code that makes this test pass.
- Add, commit with a meaningful message, and push to GitHub.

## Domain Model

From the user story:

```
As a cruise ship captain,
So I can get passengers started on their journey,
I want a ship to be able to set sail from a port.
```

The domain model for `Ship` now might look like this:

| Object | Methods    | Properties   |
|--------|------------|--------------|
| Ship   | setSail    | startingPort |

A `setSail` method has been assumed from the doing words `set sail` in the user story.

## `it can set sail`

Now we need to write the test for our new `setSail` method. In order to be able to test the method works, the state of our Ship object is going to have to change. The state in question is the `startingPort` property.

Lets see how a test might look:

![setSail test](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/avocado-on-toast.appspot.com/o/cruise-ships%2Fset_sail.png?alt=media&token=880687d7-f0ce-4663-867f-f0ecbdfbc019)

Here we have an example of a [Four-Phase Test](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/four-phase-test):

- setup `const ship = new Ship('Dover');`
- exercise `ship.setSail();`
- verify `expect(ship.startingPort).toBeFalsy();`
- teardown - Jest handles teardown for us automatically

We've used a new Jest matcher here: [toBeFalsy](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/using-matchers.html#truthiness). This does exactly what it says on the tin - expects the return value to be [falsy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Falsy).

Run your test. It should fail with :red_circle: `TypeError: ship.setSail is not a function`.

## Write the code that makes the test pass

:exclamation: You should be able to do this without the walkthrough. Once you've passed the test, then proceed.

## Add, commit with a meaningful message, and push to GitHub

Look at the last walkthrough for an example of a meaningful commit message.
