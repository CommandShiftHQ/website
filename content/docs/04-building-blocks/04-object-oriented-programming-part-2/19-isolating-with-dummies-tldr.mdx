title: "Isolating with dummies ;TLDR"
---

This is the first step of several, covering how we can isolate our unit tests so that a single test-suite only tests the object at hand (e.g. in `Ship.test.js` we only want to test `Ship` - however we are using real `Port` and `Itinerary` objects to do so). For a recap on test doubles, you can rewatch the lecture [here](https://youtu.be/ELvvFBmQGqU).

A dummy is a test double that acts as a named placeholder - we pass it into a method when that method has a required parameter and only intends to pass around the passed argument (i.e. it doesn't expect to call one of its methods or access a property). A good example might be if you have a method that adds an object to an array, and then you assert on the array that the object exists. You aren't actually using the object in any way - just passing it around.

In *Ports have Ships* chapter we created a `ship` variable with the value of an empty object to use as a placeholder for `Ship` in `Port` tests. The `ship` is a dummy as `Port` does not access any of its properties or methods, it just adds it to the `ships` array.

In Jest, we can also use `jest.fn()` to create a dummy. E.g:

```js
const basket = new Basket()
const product = jest.fn()

basket.addProduct(product)

expect(basket.products).toContain(product)
```

## Challenge

Incorporate dummies into your test suites in places where they could be used instead of the actual objects.

## To complete this challenge, you will need to:

- Look for any places in the test suite where objects are passed into methods where those methods don't use the object. 
- Replace them with dummies.
- Run your tests again to ensure they still pass (might be better to run tests after every change).
