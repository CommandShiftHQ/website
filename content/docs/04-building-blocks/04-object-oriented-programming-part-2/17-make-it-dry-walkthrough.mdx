title: "Make it DRY - Walkthrough"
---

## Steps

- Identify the test specs in `Ship.test.js` that share the same setup actions. 
- Create a new `describe` nested inside of the current `describe` `Ship` callback function, and move those test specs inside of it.
- In your nested `describe`'s callback function cut the set up actions from the test specs and add them to a `beforeEach`. 
- Run your tests and ensure they still pass.
- Do the same DRYing up inside your `Port` test suite.
- Add, commit with a meaningful message, and push to GitHub.

## Identify the test specs in `Ship.test.js` that share the same setup actions

First let's remind ourselves - using on of the specs - which part of the test is the _setup_:

```js
it('has a starting port', () => {
  const dover = new Port('Dover');
  const itinerary = new Itinerary([dover]);
  const ship = new Ship(itinerary);

  expect(ship.currentPort).toBe(dover);
});
```

The setup here would be:

```js
const dover = new Port('Dover');
const itinerary = new Itinerary([dover]);
const ship = new Ship(itinerary);
```

The remainder of this test is the _verify_ phase. Note there isn't always an _exercise_ phase, as we don't always need to call a method - in this circumstance, our object is readied for the test purely through instantiation. Whereas in this test we have an exercise phase of `ship.setSail`:

```js
it('can set sail', () => {
  const dover = new Port('Dover');
  const calais = new Port('Calais');
  const itinerary = new Itinerary([dover, calais]);
  const ship = new Ship(itinerary);

  ship.setSail();

  expect(ship.currentPort).toBeFalsy();
  expect(dover.ships).not.toContain(ship);
});
```

Looking at all the tests, 4 of them share the same (or very similar) setup actions:

```
Ship  
  can be instantiated
  has a starting port
  can set sail
  gets added to port on instantiation
```

```js
const dover = new Port('Dover');
const calais = new Port('Calais');
const itinerary = new Itinerary([dover, calais]);
const ship = new Ship(itinerary);
```

This isn't very DRY, so lets do something about it.

## Create a new `describe` nested inside of the current `describe` `Ship` callback function, and move those test specs inside of it.

By now you should have read through [Setup and Teardown](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/setup-teardown.html) on the Jest docs, so you should now know that `beforeEach` blocks have scope inside of a `describe` block. Therefore - in order to stop our setup actions for the above actions affecting other tests - we need to create a new `describe` block inside of our current `describe` block:

```js
describe('Ship', () => {
  describe('with ports and an itinerary', () => {
  });

  ...
});
```

Then move the test specs identified above into the new `describe` block:

```js
describe('with ports and an itinerary', () => {
  it('can be instantiated', () => {
    const port = new Port('Dover');
    const itinerary = new Itinerary([port]);
    const ship = new Ship(itinerary);

    expect(ship).toBeInstanceOf(Object);
  });

  it('has a starting port', () => {
    const dover = new Port('Dover');
    const itinerary = new Itinerary([dover]);
    const ship = new Ship(itinerary);

    expect(ship.currentPort).toBe(dover);
  });

  it('can set sail', () => {
    const dover = new Port('Dover');
    const calais = new Port('Calais');
    const itinerary = new Itinerary([dover, calais]);
    const ship = new Ship(itinerary);

    ship.setSail();

    expect(ship.currentPort).toBeFalsy();
    expect(dover.ships).not.toContain(ship);
  });

  it('gets added to port on instantiation', () => {
    const dover = new Port('Dover');
    const itinerary = new Itinerary([dover]);
    const ship = new Ship(itinerary);

    expect(dover.ships).toContain(ship);
  });
});
```

:exclamation: Helpful hint - if you select one or many lines of code in VS Code, and hold down `Alt` and one of the up/down keys, you can move multiple lines up and down.

## In your nested `describe`'s callback function cut the set up actions from the test specs and add them to a `beforeEach`. 

We previously identified the duplicate setup actions as being:

```js
const dover = new Port('Dover');
const calais = new Port('Calais');
const itinerary = new Itinerary([dover, calais]);
const ship = new Ship(itinerary);
```

Let's create a `beforeEach` and move these actions out of the tests:

```js
describe('with ports and an itinerary', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    const dover = new Port('Dover');
    const calais = new Port('Calais');
    const itinerary = new Itinerary([dover, calais]);
    const ship = new Ship(itinerary);
  });

  ...
});
```

You'll notice we have a lot of linter errors here on our variables. If we hover over the first one we get the error:

```
[eslint] 'ship' is assigned a value but never used. (no-unused-vars)
```

And if we hover over another we get:

```
[eslint] 'ship' is not defined. (no-undef)
```

Can you guess why? If you guessed because of scope then you'd be correct. `let` and `const` are block scoped, meaning we can go outside of a block to look for a variable, but JavaScript can't go outside a block and into another block. So inside `beforeEach` we declare our `ship` variable. It only has scope in that block, hence we get the error the variable isn't being used. Then inside a test we get the error that the variable isn't defined because JavaScript goes up a level but can't then go into `beforeEach`. The solution is to use `let` outside of the `beforeEach` and then to assign to it inside:

```js
describe('with ports and an itinerary', () => {
  let ship;
  let dover;
  let calais;
  let itinerary;

  beforeEach(() => {
    dover = new Port('Dover');
    calais = new Port('Calais');
    itinerary = new Itinerary([dover, calais]);
    ship = new Ship(itinerary);
  });

  ...
});
```

## Run your tests and ensure they still pass.

(They should).

## Do the same DRYing up inside your `Port` test suite.

:exclamation: You should be able to do this without the walkthrough.

## Add, commit with a meaningful message, and push to GitHub.
