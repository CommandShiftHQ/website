title: "What is Git?"
---

Git is a **version control system** that was originally developed to managed Linux source code.
This means that it allows you to easily view and track the progress of your code, acting as a security measure in case you make any changes you might regret!

As you work on bigger projects, where many developers contribute to the work, you'll realise how Git is so powerful and how you can easily go back in time to see differences between changes.
