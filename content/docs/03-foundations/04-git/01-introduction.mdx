Welcome to chapter 4, where you'll learn about **Git**, a tool that you'll use on a daily basis as a developer.

This chapter is slightly different than the previous one. 
The first few pages are theory, *without a practical to follow*.

***

:warning:

**We strongly recommend you don't try out the commands on the first few steps/until you get to the practical exercise, but rather read along and try to memorise the different commands and what they're used for.**

***

Worry not! There is a practical later on in this guide, where you will download a brilliant little application which will take you through this theory again in a more interactive way.

Finally, your challenge will be to contribute to our repository which holds introductions for our student roster.

Let's start!
