title: "03 - Initialising Git"

You'll often hear us talking about **repositories** (or repos). 
A repository is the place where all of your project files are stored. 
Repos can be available **locally** (in your computer) or **remotely** (in servers like Github).

*Not all repos have git initialised, since not all of your computer folders need to have their changes tracked.*

***

:warning:

**Remember**, these steps are intended to give you some light theory into Git and the various commands. We don't recommend trying these commands out at this stage, but if you *really* want to then we'd encourage you to create a dummy folder and to initialise a Git repository / experiment with the different commands inside there.

***

In order to initialise Git in a repository and start tracking your changes, move inside of the repo (project folder) you want to track and run the following command in your terminal:

```
git init
```

![git init](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/avocado-on-toast.appspot.com/o/images%2Fee02f3e96c584fd322a7aed421e1801808de64d02f13b0e78aafd9c70135.png?alt=media&token=5ca04b60-c562-4a0a-b581-51f26683b520)

If you want to check if a repo is being tracked, you can do so by:

```
git status
```

![git status](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/avocado-on-toast.appspot.com/o/images%2F24673ec3c43a727c11ce43f5e9cb8579313f99627ccd2ea5d750bf093ecf.png?alt=media&token=4a8a3799-193e-460e-9440-220bf443124d)

Or if you list the content of the repo, and if it is initialised, you should see a .git folder.

If you wish to stop tracking:

```
rm -rf .git
```
