This module is designed to get you comfortable with the tooling that developers use on our daily-basis.

Throughout the modules on this course, you’ll be navigating different types of materials, from exercises created by us, to articles/videos which will help to enhance your understanding.

The topics we’ll cover are:

- Command Line Interface
- Git
- HTML
- CSS

More than learning about these, it is essential that you adopt the correct mindset if you want to reach your full potential. This initial module is for you to build proper learning habits, while feeding your curiosity.

The next page in this chapter will provide you with some considerations on when/how to get support.
