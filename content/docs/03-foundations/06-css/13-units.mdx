title: "12 - Units"
---

Units, as we've seen, are used to express sizes or distances in your CSS rules. Declaration-wise, it's pretty much a number followed by a chosen unit. They can be absolute or relative.

- **Absolute**: px, pt
- **Relative**: 
  - em (emphemeral unit - multiply by the font size of the current element)
  - rem (root em - multiply by the font size set on the root element)
  - vh (hundredths of the viewport height)
  - vw (hundredths of the viewport width)
  - % (percent of parent element)

```css
div {
	height: 10rem;
	width: 100vw;
	padding: 5px;
	font-size: 12pt;
	margin: 2%;
}
```

**Relative measures should definitely be your preference because ideally you want your page to scale properly to different screen sizes.** If you, for example, define the height and width of an image with absolute units, the image size will look the same in a mobile screen and in an ultra-wide one.
