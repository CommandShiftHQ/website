title: "13 - Box Model"
---

As we said before, **CSS treats every HTML element as a box**, so the term **Box Model** is used when talking about design and layout.

Look at this image below:

A box (which is an element) consists of the **actual content**, which is surrounded by its **border** (that can, or not, be invisible, but always present). The space between the content and the border is what we call **padding** and, the space in the outer layer of the border is what we call **margin**.

Here's an absolute **must read** article on the [Box Model](https://medium.com/launch-school/https-medium-com-dembasiby-understanding-the-css-box-model-b005a82593a6).  

We can also see the box model for each of our elements in the dev tools. Not sure what's going on with one of your elements padding/margin? Have a look at the 'computed' tab. Have a look below:

### Practice:

***Did you read the article?*** Amazing!
Let's look at this [Codepen](https://codepen.io/manchestercodes/pen/GRZVzdx?editors=1100) we prepared for you.

The instructions are pretty simple. Without touching the CSS, try moving the html elements around, nesting them in a way that allow you to answer the questions listed.
