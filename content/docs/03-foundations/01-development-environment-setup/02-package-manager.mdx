title: "Package Manager"
---

The first thing we’ll install is a **package manager**.

A package manager is a program that you’ll use to install and update other pieces of software (aka. Packages).

There are lots of different package managers for different operating systems. We'll use **Homebrew** if you're using macOS, or **apt-get** if you're using Ubuntu.

## Installation

### Homebrew for macOS

For macOS users, we’ll use **Homebrew**, and you can find its official documentation [here](https://brew.sh/).

For the installation:

1. Open your terminal.
2. Run this command:

`/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"`

3. Once the previous command has finished running, run: `brew install wget`.

And that’s it. The installation of Homebrew might take a couple of minutes. Let us know if there are any errors.

### apt-get for Ubuntu

Life is a bit easier for Ubuntu users, because it comes with a good package manager called **apt-get**. However, let’s ensure that the package manager is up to date:

1. Open your terminal.
2. Run: `sudo apt-get update`
3. Run: `sudo apt-get upgrade`

And that’s it. Let us know if you get any errors.

Once you’ve done this, let’s proceed.
