Youâ€™ve reached the final step!

ESLint is a **linter**.

Linters **go through your code and look for mistakes**, sort of like a spelling and grammar checker for code. They can highlight errors, provide advice and include autocorrect tools. They are especially powerful when combined with a **style guide** - a preset (set of rules) that dictates how code should be written (spacing, use of semicolons etc).

Throughout the course, we'll be using ESLint with the [Standard style guide](https://standardjs.com/#standardjs--the-rules) (**Keep this link for reference**).

To set up ESLint:

1. In your terminal, install the eslint package: `npm install -g eslint`.
2. Open VS Code.
3. Click on the extensions icon in the right-side toolbar:

4. In the search box, type **ESLint** and click Install (in green) on the top result:

5. Once installed, close VS Code and open it back up again. Now you are done!
