title: "Manipulating Files"

As well as manipulating directories, we can also manipulate files.

# Creating Files

To create a new file, you can use the `touch` command, so:

1. Navigate to your desktop, which is one of the directories of your home folder.
2. Try `touch newFile`.
3. List the contents of the folder.

As an extra, check your desktop directly, which should now have a new file called `newFile` (original name, we know). If you can’t see it, it might also be because your desktop is full of a thousand files and folders. Time to get your life together and organise them!
Jokes aside, let us know if you can’t see your newest creation.

# Deleting Files

This is a throwback moment. The command you’ve used to remove a directory and its content, is primarily used to delete a file.
In this case, you won’t need the recursive switch, so this should do the job:

`rm newFile`

***A word to the wise - it is very difficult to recover a file deleted using rm (they don't go into the trash, as you might imagine they would) - so be careful when using this one.***

# Copying Files

Copying files is quite straightforward and we use `cp` for that.

The cp command takes two parameters: the **file to be copied** and the **new file** that will be created from it:

1. Move to your Desktop, if you’re not already there.
2. Create a new file called `file1`.
3. Run `cp file1 file2`.
4. List the content and you should see both files.

You can also use `cp` to **copy a directory and all of its contents**, but you have to use an `-r` switch to do so.

# Moving Files

The command to move a file also takes 2 parameters: the **file to move** and the **new location** for the file.

1. Create a new directory called `my-directory` on your Desktop.
2. Move the previously created `file1` into this new directory by running `mv file1 my-directory`.
3. List the content of this new directory without actually moving inside it. Do you remember how?

# Renaming Files

Good things come in pairs, or so they say?
You can also rename a file using the `mv` command. If the second parameter you give is a directory, it will move the file into that directory, but if the path doesn't exist, then it will move the file to that location with that name:

1. Move into `my-directory`.
2. Run `mv file1 renamedFile`.
3. List all the contents to do a quick check.

Because `renamedFile` isn’t an actual subdirectory of the `my-directory` folder, it renames `file1` to `renamedFile` instead.
Helpful and easy to remember.
