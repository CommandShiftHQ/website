title: "Navigating"

Now that we know that Desktop is a directory, let’s move into it.

To change our working directory, we can use the `cd` command, followed by the directory’s **filepath**.

From your home directory **(~)**, try:

`cd Desktop/`

- Print your work directory with the command we already learned and see if it worked!

What if you want to go back?
The parent’s filepath is represented by **..**, so running `cd ..` will **bring you back up a level**.

Another couple of handy shortcuts for navigating are `~` and `/`.

- `cd ~` will bring you back to your home directory from anywhere in the file system.
- `cd /` will bring you to your computer's root directory from anywhere in the file system so to navigate to your `Desktop` directory from anywhere, you can type `cd ~/Desktop` or `cd /Users/{yourname}/Desktop`.

This also works with `ls`, or any command that requires a filepath.
