In order to tackle all of the tracks in this course, you’ll need some tooling available on your machine. In this part of the course we'll set up the tools you need to start programming.

At first everything will seem a bit strange and unknown, but as you progress you'll learn more about these tools. You’ll come to understand them and you’ll probably expand your arsenal as well.

Setting up your development environment is a bit of a robotic job in the sense that there’s not much to discuss at this point. We’ll explore most of these tools in the upcoming lectures. For now we'll focus on getting your development environment up and running.

Let's start!
