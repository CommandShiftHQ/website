# Doctype

In order to achieve a certain DOM - which resides in the browser - you'll have to create a HTML document which tends to follow a standardised structure.

Let's look at the following example:

![Page Structure](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/avocado-on-toast.appspot.com/o/html_structure.png?alt=media&token=d3920bce-e800-48ca-9c72-6fd52cf71333)

`<!DOCTYPE html>`

All webpages should begin with this special declaration.
The sole purpose of it is to tell the browser **which version of HTML the page is using**, although browsers usually display the page even if it's not included.
Once you get to the CSS chapter and you learn about the Box Model, you'll realise that the use of a `DOCTYPE` can also **help the browser to render the page correctly**.
By declaring it as it is in this example, the browser will be aware that the html we'll be serving is version 5.

### `<html></html>`

The opening `<html>` tag indicates that anything between it and its respective closing tag will be **HTML markup**.

### `<head></head>`

The `<head>` tag indicates that anything between it and its respective closing tag is **metadata** (data about data). **None of this info will be directly displayed in the page**.

Notice that in this element, there's a child with the tag of `<title>`.
Whatever its content is, it will represent the document title and will be **shown in the browser's page tab**.
It's also the default label of the page when it's added to a user's favourites.


**Note:** Titles are very **important for search engine optimisation (SEO)**, since they're used by search engine algorithms when listing pages in search results.

### `<body></body>`

The `<body>` tag indicates that anything between it and its respective closing tag should be shown in the main browser window.

# Practical

By now, you should have your VS Code open with the `index.html`. If not, please refer to the Introduction chapter.

1. Create the basic structure of the html file, which should have the following elements:
    1. DOCTYPE
    2. Html
    3. Head
        1. Title
    4. Body
2. Let's put your name as the title.
3. Save the document.
4. Back to your terminal, you can run `open index.html` (`xdg-open index.html` on Ubuntu) and a new browser/tab should open with the HTML file.
5. Once you're happy with the result, add the file to the staging area, commit it with a meaningful message and push it to GitHub.

It should be blank because no content was added to the body yet. However, look at the tab name - it should be yours!
