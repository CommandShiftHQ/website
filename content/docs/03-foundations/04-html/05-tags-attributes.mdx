title: "Tags & Attributes"
---

Every DOM element has a **type**, which semantically **should denote its purpose** and provide some default layout, style and display properties.

# Tags

Elements have what we call **tags**. In most of them, you'll see an *opening tag* and a *closing tag*. In some particular cases, which we'll see in this module, the element only has an opening one.

Let's look at the example below:

`<p>Welcome to this chapter!</p>`


Let's deconstruct the first one:
- `<p>` is the opening tag.
- **"Welcome to this chapter!"** is the actual text that gets rendered in your webpage.
- `</p>` is the closing tag.

As you might have spotted, one of the differences between an opening and a closing tag is the forward slash (`/`) symbol, right before the indication of the tag's type (which in this case is `p` - as short for **paragraph**).
The characters in the brackets (`<>`) indicate the **tag's purpose**.

Even though, the terms "tag" and "element" are often used interchangeably, strictly speaking, the **element comprises both opening and closing tags and any content that lies between them**.

Understanding and using the different terms properly will be something we'll push you to do in order to be able to talk about code confidently.

Let's now look closely at the second example:

`<img src="./cool-alpaca.png" alt="Cool Alpaca" />`

Can you spot the difference?
This different tag - which will render an image, as you might have guessed - is a **self-closing tag**, which means **it doesn't have a separate closing tag**.

Also, remember when we said that `/` was one of the differences between opening and closing tags?
That's because, as you can see by looking at the example 2, opening/self-closing tags can - and most often will - hold some **attributes**.

# Attributes

Attributes will provide **additional information** about the contents of an element. They're made up of two parts: a **name** and a **value**, **separated by an equals sign**.
In the example above, `src` is an attribute of `img` that points towards **where to find the image file**, while `alt` is another attribute that holds some **text that only gets displayed if there's an issue while rendering the image**. You'll get to experiment with this later.

The majority of attributes can only be used on certain elements, but a few are shared between different ones. Also, most attribute values are either pre-defined or follow a stipulated format. You'll learn more about these as you keep using them.
