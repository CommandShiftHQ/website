title: "HTML"

Hello again!

So, by now, you should be familiar with both the **command line** and **git** - everyone's favourite version control system.

In this chapter, you'll learn about **HTML** - the skeleton of your application pages. Later on, we'll dive into CSS, which you can think of as the skin, and once in Building Blocks, we'll discuss JavaScript as the muscles.

In each page of this chapter, we'll discuss a different sub-topic of HTML and **you'll be encouraged to work on a project as you go.**

So, the first thing to do is to setup that project:

1. In your GitHub, create a new repository called `portfolio`.
2. On your local machine, and using the command line, move into your projects folder and create a subdirectory with the same name.
3. Connect your local repo with your GitHub one.
4. Back to your terminal, create a new file called `index.html`.
5. Open this `index.html` file in your VS Code.

And we're good to start!

***Don't forget to take some notes as you go.***
