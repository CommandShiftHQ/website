There are lots of occasions when we need to use lists. Who doesn't love a good list?

HTML provide us with 3 different types:

- Ordered lists.
- Unordered lists.
- Definition lists.

Browsers indent lists by default.

# Ordered Lists

The ordered list is created with the `<ol>` element.
Each item in the list is placed between `<li>` and `</li>` tags.

Each item in this list, as you might have guessed, is **numbered**.

Check the example below, which lists our modules:

<CodePen id="NWwOBZJ" title="Ordered list" />

# Unordered Lists

The unordered list is created with the `<ul>` element.
Each item in this type of list is also placed between `<li>` and `</li>` tags.

These lists use **bulletpoints**.

Check the example below with the instructors per module:

<CodePen id="VwrEGLy" title="Unordered lists" />

# Definition Lists

These lists are comprised of a set of terms along with the definitions.
They're created with `<dl>` element and tends to have pairs: the term, represented by `<dt>`, and the definition, by `<dd>`.

*Sometimes you might see a list where there are two terms used for the same definition or two different definitions for the same term.*

Check the example below with the analogy we made at the beginning around HTML, CSS and Javascript:

<CodePen id="abVRaBW" title="Definition lists" />


# Nested Lists

As an extra, know that you can put a second list inside of an `<li>` element to create a sublist/nested list.
The browser will display this nested list further indented than the parent list.

In a nested unordered list, the browser will usually **change the style of the bullet point too**.

Check the example below and look at how we would nest the list of instructors, inside the respective module:

<CodePen id="XWzxPRp" title="Nested lists" />

# Practical

1. Create a new section in your document structure.
2. Add a new heading element and add the text "**Qualities**".
3. Create an ordered list that tells the reader your top 3 qualities.
4. Create a new section and add the heading "**Hobbies & Interests**".
5. Create an unordered list that tells the user your hobbies.
6. Once you're happy with the result, add the file to the staging area, commit it with a meaningful message and push it to GitHub.

Your portfolio is now getting in shape.

Once you've done this, proceed.
