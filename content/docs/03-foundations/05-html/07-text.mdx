Ok, now that we've learned about page structure, it's time to start creating some content for our page.


# Headings

HTML has **six levels** of headings. If you recall from the previous example, we had 1 heading (`h1`), but we could have gone up to `h6`.

`<h1>` is used for **main headings**. It's important that your page displays **one**, and only one, h1 element (**SEO impact**, once again).

`<h2>` is used for subheadings.

If there are further sections under the subheadings, then `<h3>` should be used and so on.

Your browser will interpret display headings with different sizes, with the `h1` being the largest and `h6` the smallest.


# Paragraphs

We've also visited these ones already.
Just as a recap, the paragraph content must be encapsulated between its opening and closing tags.

By default, a browser will show each paragraph on a new line with some space between it and any subsequent ones.

```
<p>This is the first paragraph!</p>
<p>This is the second paragraph!</p>
```


# Bold & Italic

**Bold** is represented by `<b></b>` and all of its content will appear bold.
Visually, we could use these tags in **keywords** of a paragraph, for example.

By association, `<i></i>` will display its content in **italic**.
It tends to represent a section of text that would be said in a different way from surrounding content - **technical terms**, **foreign words**, **thoughts**.


# Superscript & Subscript

**Superscript** is represented by `<sup></sup>` and it can be used in things such as **suffixes of dates or mathematical concepts**.

For example, the code `X<sup>2</sup>` will render as "X<sup>2</sup>".

**Subscript** works as the opposite and is represented by `<sub></sub>`. It's ideal for **foot notes or chemical elements**.

For example, if you wanted to write the chemical element "H<sub>2</sub>O" you would write `H<sub>2</sub>O`.


# Whitespace

When we start learning about HTML, we tend to space-out elements in the markup that we would like to see spaced out when displayed.
However, when the browser is reading your markup, if it comes across two or more spaces next to each other, it only displays one space. 
If the browser comes across a line break, it treats this as a single space too which is known as white space collapsing.

The advantage is that you can use proper indentation which helps your code to be read easily without worrying about its impact on the display.

In the same document you have been working on, type inside the body tag:

```
<p>There are no spaces here.</p>
<p>There are         some spaces here.</p>
<p>There are definitely loads of                                spaces here.</p>
```

Save the document and open it in the browser. Interesting, right?

Before you proceed, don't forget to delete these paragraphs.


# LineBreaks & Horizontal Rules

Now you might be asking how you could add a line break or a couple of line breaks.

Well, if you want to add a line break, all you have to do is to use the `<br />` element, which is also a self-closing one.

Try:

```
<p>This is the first paragraph.</p>
<p>This is the second paragraph.</p>
<br />
<p>This is the third paragraph, which is a bit distant from its siblings.</p>
```

There's also an element called a "horizontal rule" which creates a horizontal line as well as line break.
Try adding `<hr />`, another self-closing element, between the first a second paragraphs.

Save the document and have a look. Once you're able to see both the line-breaks and horizontal rules, let's advance to the practical.

# Practical

1. Delete the previous work, leaving the body tag empty.
2. Add a `h1` element that contains your name.
3. Add a `h2` element that contains either a slogan, or some meaningful text that introduces you as a junior developer.
4. Introduce a line break and a horizontal line since we're about to start a new section.
5. Add a `h3` element with the text "About Me".
6. Below this `h3` element, add 2 paragraphs, one that tells the reader who you are and another that demonstrates how you got into code.
7. Once you're happy with the result, add the file to the staging area, commit it with a meaningful message and push it to GitHub.

Ours looks like this:

Once you have done this, proceed to the next page.
