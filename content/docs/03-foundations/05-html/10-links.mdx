title: "09 - Links"

Let's now talk about the defining feature of the web - links.

**Links** are why you can move from one page to another.

# Writing Links

Links are created using the `<a>` element. Users can click on anything between the opening and closing anchor tags.
In order to specify the page we want to link to, we use the `href` attribute:

`<a href="https://platform.manchestercodes.com/" target="_blank">Manchester Codes Platform</a>`

- Where possible, the link text should explain to the visitors where they'll be taken to if they click on it (avoid, at all costs, "Click here" situations).
- Link text is important for more common users since they're part of your application map, but they're absolute **fundamental for screen readers**.
- The second attribute - `target` - is entirely optional, but when present and set to `_blank`, if the link is clicked, it will open in a new tab instead of just loading the new page.

# Internal & External Links

The value of the `href` attribute can vary depending on the type of link you want to create.

Do you want to link it to another website? Well, the example above is the one to go for.

Do you want to link to another page of your own application? Sure thing. In your portfolio, if you want to move from `index.html` to the `contact-me.html` page:

`<a href="./contact-me.html">Contact Me</a>`

What about if you want to create a link to a section on the same page? Like, one that when clicked scrolls the page to the exact spot?
Yep, that is also possible.

All you need to do is to give the element we want to link to an attribute of `id`, and use that `id` as a value to the `href` of your anchor:

```
<a href="#about-me">About Me</a>

â€¦

<section id="about-me">
```

(Notice the **#** before the `id` in the `href` attribute. The hash indicates that what's in front of it is an id. You'll learn more about it in the CSS lectures.)


# Directory Structure & Relative URLs

On larger projects, it's a good idea to organise your code by placing the different pages inside their own folder/directory. The same applies to images.

In this case, if you create a couple more pages, your portfolio's project will have a structure like:

```
/portfolio
	/images
		me.png
	index.html
	/pages
		contact-me.html
		projects.html
```

Can you decipher the structure above? So:

- For this project, /portfolio represents your root.
- The root has 2 subdirectories and an `index.html` file.
- One of the subdirectories is called images and has 1 image which could be a photo of yours.
- The other subdirectory is called pages and holds 2 more html documents for different pages of your portfolio.

The relationship between the files and folders of your portfolio is described using the same terminology of the DOM tree.

If we look at **/portfolio** as being the parent, then **/images**, `index.html` and **/pages** are its children.

`contact-me.html` and `projects.html` are the children of **/pages**, but also the grandchildren of **/portfolio**.

Every page and every image on a website has a **URL**, which stands for **Uniform Resource Locator**, that is made up of the domain name followed by the path to the very same page or image.

If the domain name is `johndoe.dev`, then, your landing page would have the url of `johndoe.dev/index.html` and if the user then clicks on your "Contact Me" link, the url will change to: `johndoe.dev/pages/contact-me.html`.

`/pages/contact-me.html` is the **relative path** in your project that is used to locate the page.

For relative paths:

- `./` represents the same folder of the current file.
- `../` represents the parent folder of the current file.
- `../../` represents the grandparent folder of the current file.
- `/pages` (eg.) will represent a child of the current directory.

**Note:** servers are usually setup to return `index.html` unless specified otherwise, which is why we're using this file name.


# Email Links

You can also create a link that starts up the user's email software and addresses an email to a specified email address. 
The value of href should be composed of the keyword `mailto` and respective email, separated by a colon:

`<a href="mailto:johndoe@dev.com">Email Me</a>`


# Practical

Ok, let's spice things up a bit;

1. In your project's root create 2 new folders - one called images and another called pages.
2. Inside pages, create 2 new html files - `contact.html` and `projects.html`. (Bonus points if you've done this using your terminal! You should know how-to by now.)
3. Inside images, add your photo, which we'll use later on this module.
4. Back to your `index.html`, add a navigation to the header (using the proper markup) and create 2 links - one to each of the new pages. Don't forget to consider the relative path. Ensure that when clicked, they'll open in a new page.
5. Let's go a bit further and for each new page, add the basic HTML structure, with a title per page, and a heading that is indicative of which page you're visiting. Leave the rest empty for now.
6. Once you're happy with the result, add the project files to the staging area, commit it with a meaningful message and push it to GitHub.

The goal is to ensure that when you click on the link to the contact page, it opens a new tab that shows you Contact Me as the heading. Same for the projects page.

Once you've achieved this, proceed.
