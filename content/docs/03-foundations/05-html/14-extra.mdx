**Congratulations!**

You've reached the end of the HTML chapter and there was so much to discuss, right?
There's more, really. 
HTML is such an important topic and with so much information that it would be impossible to go over all of it in one go.

The brilliant thing is that you'll keep using it during this course and after it, so your experience will contribute massively to improve your overall knowledge.

Try researching and reading on *iframes*, *HTML comments*, *meta tags* and *escape characters*. We'll leave this one to you!

In the next chapter - CSS - we'll take this project to the next level by learning about styling rules. It will be your chance to give it a new face.

For now, take a break, ensure your notes are on point and that you understand all of the topics. We're here to support you with the latter!
