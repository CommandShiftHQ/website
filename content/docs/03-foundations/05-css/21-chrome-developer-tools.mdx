title: "Chrome Developer Tools"

You'll quickly realise that we love a good resource!

As a developer, you'll learn that your browser comes with a set of Developer tools that enable you to debug and experiment with code without having to access your code editor constantly.

On our course we will be using Chrome to develop and debug webpages and applications, which prepared a set of tutorials to help you to get familiar with their own version of the Developer Tools. For now, we suggest that you have, on this order, a look at:

1. [Open Chrome DevTools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/open/)
2. [CSS - View and Change CSS](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/css/)
3. [CSS - Features Reference](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/css/reference/)
4. [CSS - Inspect CSS Grid](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/css/grid/)

We won't encourage, at this stage, to do any further tutorials. We'll have plenty of chances later!
