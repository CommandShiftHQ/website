title: "Pseudo-Class Selectors"
---

##### Quick note - this is an advanced selector!

Pseudo-classes are keywords added to a selector in the following form:

```css
selector:pseudo-class {
}
```

**Notice that the pseudo-class and the selector are separated by a colon (:).**

We use this to specify elements with a specific state or case. For example, we might want to change the element's background colour if a mouse hovers the element. We can do so with:

```css
selector:hover {
}
```

**Note:** _selector_ can be a class, an id, an element, whichever you decide.

Have a look at some [documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes) to find out about different states we can target.

## This is a fun one, let's try it out!

### Lets try some of the more popular ones - :hover, :active, :visited, :checked, :disabled

1. Let's add another block of html to help us demonstrate these selectors

```html
<div id="“socials”">
  <h3>My Socials</h3>
  /* These links are just a demo, so i've left the href blank. */
  <p>Follow me on <a href="">Twitter</a>!</p>
  <p>Follow me on <a href="">Instagram</a>!</p>
  /* The below are form elements, we will get to those later on so don't worry
  about these just yet, we just need them for demo purposes */
  <input type="checkbox" id="box" name="test-checkbox" checked />
  <label for="test-checkbox">Check this box for some reason</label>
  /*The button below is just a demo, so it doesn't do anything, we will add the
  disabled attribute though, more on that below...*/
  <button disabled>You can't press this...</button>
</div>
```

2. Great! Now let's see if we can change a style based on whether the checkbox is checked.  
   Target your checkbox using the ID

```css
#box {
}
```

Then let's add a coloured outline using [outline](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/outline):

```css
#box {
  outline: 3px solid green;
}
```

Save and refresh and see what happens with your checkbox.

3. Now let's modify the style for the checkbox by adding a pseudo-class selector:

```css
#box:checked {
  outline: 3px solid green;
}
```
Save and refresh, then click on the checkbox and see what happens.

4. Can you change the colour of the label text green, whenever the box is checked? I'll give you a clue, you could use the adjacent sibling selector!

```css
#box:checked + label {
  color: green;
}
```

5. Try this one yourself - use the `:hover` pseudo class on any of your elements, try a few! Change the colour, size or font, anything you fancy! Save and refresh in the browser to see what happens when you hover over that element with your mouse.

6. If you noticed, we added a disabled button to the code block. We use the 'disabled' attribute to ensure the user cannot press it (remove this attribute to see what happens). Try using the `:disabled` pseudo class to change the style of a disabled button.

7. What about `:visited` and `:active?` Try popping these selectors on your link (anchor) elements. Target each link using the two pseudo selectors, and change the colours, a different one for each link. Then save and refresh your browser, click your links and see what's happened!

> Have you noticed that on Google, the sites you've already visited are purple? If you want to change this default behaviour on your own website, :visited is the selector for you!

If you struggled to get any of these to work, make a note and ask your tutor in the next class.
