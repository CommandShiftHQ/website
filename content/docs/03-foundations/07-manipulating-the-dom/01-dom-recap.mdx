If you have gotten this far, well done! You have covered a lot in the last four weeks! If you still have some time before Building Blocks starts, and want to challenge yourself, have a look at the following pages on Manipulating the DOM. We will cover this in more detail towards the end of Building Blocks, when you have the opportunity to use these skills to create a GUI for your Cruise Ships project.

As you should know by now, **DOM** stands for **D**ocument **O**bject **M**odel and it is an interactive representation of and HTML document, created by the Browser. It is tree-shaped based, so all of its elements are organised in nodes.

A node is any DOM object, with element being one of its types. Even though all elements are nodes, not all nodes are elements. You can have text nodes, the document node and comment nodes.
